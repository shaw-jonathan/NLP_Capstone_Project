Star Wars,"Sleek, swift, and deadly, the famed X-wing fighters have earned their reputation as the Rebel Alliance's ultimate strike force the hard way—first in battle, the last line of defense. Now they must make a deal with the devil herself—an enemy whose ultimate goal is their total annihilation.

It's the kind of mission only Wedge Antilles and the Rogue Squadron would dare to undertake. Against impossible odds they will stage a daring raid into an enemy stronghold—only to be rescued from certain destruction by an unexpected ally. Ysanne Isard, the ruthless Imperial commander, has appeared on the scene seemingly from out of nowhere. Now she proposes a most unusual alliance, offering to help Wedge rescue his captured comrades from Imperial Warlord Admiral Krennel's sadistic prison camp. But her offer is not without a price. Wedge must lead Rogue Squadron in Isard's deadly struggle against an enemy made in her own image. It's an offer Wedge would love to refuse, for Isard is certain to betray them. But how can they leave their comrades at Krennel's mercy? The answer is: they can't—even if it means being caught between Krennel's ruthlessness and Isard's treachery.","['Science fiction', 'Fighter pilots', 'Fiction', 'Fiction, science fiction, space opera', 'Antilles, wedge (fictitious character), fiction', 'Horn, corran (fictitious character), fiction', 'collectionID:swNRa']",,,,,['OL40284A'],7,sleek swift and deadly the famed xwing fighters have earned their reputation as the rebel alliances ultimate strike force the hard wayfirst in battle the last line of defense now they must make a deal with the devil herselfan enemy whose ultimate goal is their total annihilation its the kind of mission only wedge antilles and the rogue squadron would dare to undertake against impossible odds they will stage a daring raid into an enemy strongholdonly to be rescued from certain destruction by an unexpected ally ysanne isard the ruthless imperial commander has appeared on the scene seemingly from out of nowhere now she proposes a most unusual alliance offering to help wedge rescue his captured comrades from imperial warlord admiral krennels sadistic prison camp but her offer is not without a price wedge must lead rogue squadron in isards deadly struggle against an enemy made in her own image its an offer wedge would love to refuse for isard is certain to betray them but how can they leave their comrades at krennels mercy the answer is they canteven if it means being caught between krennels ruthlessness and isards treachery,14
Principles of the institutional law of international organizations,"This is one of the first books to appear in the relaunched Cambridge Studies in International and Comparative Law and it addresses the institutional aspect of the law of international organizations. Dr. Amerasinghe starts with a brief history of international organizations.

In fourteen substantive chapters, he then deals with subjects such as interpretation, membership and representation, the doctrine of ultra vires, responsibility, liability of members to third parties, internal law and employment relations, privileges and immunities, dispute settlement, and, finally, dissolution and succession. There is a full and detailed examination of the problems connected with each of these subjects.

The primary object of the book is to discuss principles, but Dr Amerasinghe also studies the law and practice of different organizations, using a rigorous analysis of the material alongside his functional examination of the law.",['International agencies'],,,,,['OL9705A'],4,this is one of the first books to appear in the relaunched cambridge studies in international and comparative law and it addresses the institutional aspect of the law of international organizations dr amerasinghe starts with a brief history of international organizations in fourteen substantive chapters he then deals with subjects such as interpretation membership and representation the doctrine of ultra vires responsibility liability of members to third parties internal law and employment relations privileges and immunities dispute settlement and finally dissolution and succession there is a full and detailed examination of the problems connected with each of these subjects the primary object of the book is to discuss principles but dr amerasinghe also studies the law and practice of different organizations using a rigorous analysis of the material alongside his functional examination of the law,4

Dreams,"Before the dawn of history mankind was engaged in the study of dreaming. The wise man among the ancients was preeminently the interpreter of dreams. The ability to interpret successfully or plausibly was the quickest road to royal favor, as Joseph and Daniel found it to be; failure to give satisfaction in this respect led to banishment from court or death. When a scholar laboriously translates a cuneiform tablet dug up from a Babylonian mound where it has lain buried for five thousand years or more, the chances are that it will turn out either an astrological treatise or a dream book. If the former, we look upon it with some indulgence; if the latter with pure contempt. For we know that the study of the stars, though undertaken for selfish reasons and pursued in the spirit of charlatanry, led at length to physical science, while the study of dreams has proved as unprofitable as the dreaming of them. Out of astrology grew astronomy. Out of oneiromancy has grown - nothing.That at least was substantially true up to the beginning of the present century. Dream books in all languages continued to sell in cheap editions and the interpreters of dreams made a decent or, at any rate, a comfortable living out of the poorer classes. But the psychologist rarely paid attention to dreams except incidentally in his study of imagery, association and the speed of thought. But now a change has come over the spirit of the times. The subject of the significance of dreams, so long ignored, has suddenly become a matter of energetic study and of fiery controversy the world over.The cause of this revival of interest is the new point of view brought forward by Professor Bergson in the paper which is here made accessible to the English-reading public. This is the idea that we can explore the unconscious substratum of our mentality, the storehouse of our memories, by means of dreams, for these memories are by no means inert, but have, as it were, a life and purpose of their own, and strive to rise into consciousness whenever they get a chance, even into the semi-consciousness of a dream. To use Professor Bergson's striking metaphor, our memories are packed away under pressure like steam in a boiler and the dream is their escape valve.That this is more than a mere metaphor has been proved by Professor Freud and others of the Vienna school, who cure cases of hysteria by inducing the patient to give expression to the secret anxieties and emotions which, unknown to him, have been preying upon his mind. The clue to these disturbing thoughts is generally obtained in dreams or similar states of relaxed consciousness. According to the Freudians a dream always means something, but never what it appears to mean. It is symbolic and expresses desires or fears which we refuse ordinarily to admit to consciousness, either because they are painful or because they are repugnant to our moral nature. A watchman is stationed at the gate of consciousness to keep them back, but sometimes these unwelcome intruders slip past him in disguise.","['Dreams', 'New Age', 'Nonfiction', 'Psychology', 'Numismatics', 'Numismatique']",,,,,['OL18539A'],6,before the dawn of history mankind was engaged in the study of dreaming the wise man among the ancients was preeminently the interpreter of dreams the ability to interpret successfully or plausibly was the quickest road to royal favor as joseph and daniel found it to be failure to give satisfaction in this respect led to banishment from court or death when a scholar laboriously translates a cuneiform tablet dug up from a babylonian mound where it has lain buried for five thousand years or more the chances are that it will turn out either an astrological treatise or a dream book if the former we look upon it with some indulgence if the latter with pure contempt for we know that the study of the stars though undertaken for selfish reasons and pursued in the spirit of charlatanry led at length to physical science while the study of dreams has proved as unprofitable as the dreaming of them out of astrology grew astronomy out of oneiromancy has grown nothingthat at least was substantially true up to the beginning of the present century dream books in all languages continued to sell in cheap editions and the interpreters of dreams made a decent or at any rate a comfortable living out of the poorer classes but the psychologist rarely paid attention to dreams except incidentally in his study of imagery association and the speed of thought but now a change has come over the spirit of the times the subject of the significance of dreams so long ignored has suddenly become a matter of energetic study and of fiery controversy the world overthe cause of this revival of interest is the new point of view brought forward by professor bergson in the paper which is here made accessible to the englishreading public this is the idea that we can explore the unconscious substratum of our mentality the storehouse of our memories by means of dreams for these memories are by no means inert but have as it were a life and purpose of their own and strive to rise into consciousness whenever they get a chance even into the semiconsciousness of a dream to use professor bergsons striking metaphor our memories are packed away under pressure like steam in a boiler and the dream is their escape valvethat this is more than a mere metaphor has been proved by professor freud and others of the vienna school who cure cases of hysteria by inducing the patient to give expression to the secret anxieties and emotions which unknown to him have been preying upon his mind the clue to these disturbing thoughts is generally obtained in dreams or similar states of relaxed consciousness according to the freudians a dream always means something but never what it appears to mean it is symbolic and expresses desires or fears which we refuse ordinarily to admit to consciousness either because they are painful or because they are repugnant to our moral nature a watchman is stationed at the gate of consciousness to keep them back but sometimes these unwelcome intruders slip past him in disguise,4

'Round about midnight,"From 1975 to 1981 the jazz giant Miles Davis temporarily retired from music. Almost completely reclusive, nobody outside of a very close circle knew what was happening to him. Rumors abounded: he was sick, he was dying, he was healthy; he was playing the trumpet, the organ, nothing at all. Only one jazz writer was able to get close to him during this time: Eric Nisenson. From 1978 to 1981 Nisenson conducted dozens of interviews with Miles Davis and his associates.

The result was 'Round About Midnight, an engaging firsthand account of Miles's fascinating and difficult career.

From his recordings with Charlie Parker and the Birth of the Cool nonet, through the Coltrane quintet, the Gil Evans-arranged masterpieces of the sixties, the landmark Kind of Blue album, the Shorter/Hancock/Carter/Williams group, and the success of his fusion recordings of the seventies, Miles's personality - contemplative, abruptly defiant, strong, elegant - meshed with his art to form one of the most compelling legends in the history of American music.

While actively disdaining his audience, he sought to broaden it by incorporating elements of other musics - classical, flamenco, rock, funk - into his uncompromising jazz. This contradictory combination of contempt and a desire for recognition fueled controversy in both his public and private lives, and resulted in Miles's lengthy self-imposed isolation.

. Nisenson broke through that isolation, and his biographical portrait is vivid and telling. This updated edition features a new preface, new material covering Miles in the eighties, and a new recommended listening section.","['Biography', 'Jazz musicians', 'United States', 'Davis, miles, 1926-1991']",['United States'],['Miles Davis'],,,['OL39499A'],6,from 1975 to 1981 the jazz giant miles davis temporarily retired from music almost completely reclusive nobody outside of a very close circle knew what was happening to him rumors abounded he was sick he was dying he was healthy he was playing the trumpet the organ nothing at all only one jazz writer was able to get close to him during this time eric nisenson from 1978 to 1981 nisenson conducted dozens of interviews with miles davis and his associates the result was round about midnight an engaging firsthand account of miless fascinating and difficult career from his recordings with charlie parker and the birth of the cool nonet through the coltrane quintet the gil evansarranged masterpieces of the sixties the landmark kind of blue album the shorterhancockcarterwilliams group and the success of his fusion recordings of the seventies miless personality contemplative abruptly defiant strong elegant meshed with his art to form one of the most compelling legends in the history of american music while actively disdaining his audience he sought to broaden it by incorporating elements of other musics classical flamenco rock funk into his uncompromising jazz this contradictory combination of contempt and a desire for recognition fueled controversy in both his public and private lives and resulted in miless lengthy selfimposed isolation nisenson broke through that isolation and his biographical portrait is vivid and telling this updated edition features a new preface new material covering miles in the eighties and a new recommended listening section,4

Penguins & Golden Calves,"Despite protests and warnings from friends and family, author Madeleine L’Engle, at the age of seventy-four, embarked on a rafting trip to Antarctica.

The Man Without Content (Meridian: Crossing Aesthetics),"In this book, one of Italy's most important and original contemporary philosophers considers the status of art in the modern era. He takes seriously Hegel's claim that art has exhausted its spiritual vocation, that it is no longer through art that Spirit principally comes to knowledge of itself.

Literature and Material Culture from Balzac to Proust,"This book addresses the issues of collecting, consuming, classifying and describing the curiosities, antiques and objets d'art that proliferated in French literary texts during the last decades of the nineteenth century. After Balzac made such issues significant in canonical literature, the Goncourt brothers, Huysmans, MallarmE and Maupassant celebrated their golden age. Flaubert and Zola scorned them. Rachilde and Lorrain perverted them. Proust commemorated their last moments of glory. Focusing on the bibelot (the modern French term for knick-knack, curiosity or other collectible), Janell Watson shows how the sudden prominence given to curiosities and collecting in nineteenth-century literature signals a massive change in attitudes to the world of goods, which in turn restructured the literary text according to the practical logic of daily life, calling into question established scholarly notions of order.

The audience consists of those taking the first calculus course, in high school or college. The approach is the one which was successful decades ago, involving clarity, and adjusted to a time when the students'background was not as substantial as it might be.

"I Am a Soldier, Too","On March 23, 2003, Private First Class Jessica Lynch was crossing the Iraqi desert with the 507th Maintenance Company when the convoy she was traveling in was ambushed, caught in enemy crossfire. All four soldiers traveling with her died in the attack. Lynch, perhaps the most famous P.O.W. this country has ever known, was taken prisoner and held captive in an Iraqi hospital for nine days. Her rescue galvanized the nation; she became a symbol of victory, of innocence and courage, of heroism; and then, just as quickly, of deceit and manipulation. What never changed, as the nation veered wildly between these extremes of mythmaking, was her story, the events and the experiences of a nineteen-year-old girl caught up in what was and will remain the battle of her life: what she saw, what she felt, what she experienced, what she survived. I Am a Soldier, Too: The Jessica Lynch Story is the story this country has hungered for, as told by Lynch herself to Pulitzer Prize--winning author Rick Bragg. In it, she tells what really happened in the ambush; what really happened in the hospital; what really happened, from her perspective, on the night of the rescue. More than this, the collaboration between Lynch and Bragg captures who she is and where she's from: her childhood in Palestine, West Virginia, a lovely, rugged stretch of land always referred to as the hollow, where she rode horses, played softball, and was crowned Miss Congeniality at the Wirt County Fair the same year the steer she raised took a ribbon. It reveals  her relationships with her older brother, Greg Jr., also an enlisted soldier, and her younger sister, Brandi; with her father, Greg Sr., a forty-three-year-old truck driver who has at times worked construction, cut hay, cut firewood, hauled timber, hauled concrete, run a bulldozer, run a backhoe, cleaned houses, and dug graves; and with her mother, Deadra, a city girl from Parkersburg who moved to the hollow and met her future husband when he was eleven and she was nine. And it describes what happened to the Lynch family in the agony of Jessica's capture and captivity; the terror and disbelief that cascaded through an entire town at the news of her disappearance into enemy hands; the joy of her rescue; and the long work of healing and recovery that lie ahead. Jessica Lynch has won the hearts and minds of Americans. In the hands of Rick Bragg, a renowned chronicler of American lives, her tale is told at last, with grace, and care, and astonishing candor.From the Hardcover edition.","['Biography', 'Prisoners of war', 'American Personal narratives', 'Women soldiers', 'Iraq War, 2003', 'Iraq War, 2003-', 'American', 'War', 'Biography & Autobiography', 'Nonfiction', 'Krijgsgevangenen', 'Amerikanen', 'Vrouwen', 'Iraq War, 2003-2011', 'Journalists, biography']","['United States', 'Iraq']","['Jessica Lynch (1983-)', 'Jessica Lynch']",,,['OL31918A'],9,on march 23 2003 private first class jessica lynch was crossing the iraqi desert with the 507th maintenance company when the convoy she was traveling in was ambushed caught in enemy crossfire all four soldiers traveling with her died in the attack lynch perhaps the most famous pow this country has ever known was taken prisoner and held captive in an iraqi hospital for nine days her rescue galvanized the nation she became a symbol of victory of innocence and courage of heroism and then just as quickly of deceit and manipulation what never changed as the nation veered wildly between these extremes of mythmaking was her story the events and the experiences of a nineteenyearold girl caught up in what was and will remain the battle of her life what she saw what she felt what she experienced what she survived i am a soldier too the jessica lynch story is the story this country has hungered for as told by lynch herself to pulitzer prizewinning author rick bragg in it she tells what really happened in the ambush what really happened in the hospital what really happened from her perspective on the night of the rescue more than this the collaboration between lynch and bragg captures who she is and where shes from her childhood in palestine west virginia a lovely rugged stretch of land always referred to as the hollow where she rode horses played softball and was crowned miss congeniality at the wirt county fair the same year the steer she raised took a ribbon it reveals her relationships with her older brother greg jr also an enlisted soldier and her younger sister brandi with her father greg sr a fortythreeyearold truck driver who has at times worked construction cut hay cut firewood hauled timber hauled concrete run a bulldozer run a backhoe cleaned houses and dug graves and with her mother deadra a city girl from parkersburg who moved to the hollow and met her future husband when he was eleven and she was nine and it describes what happened to the lynch family in the agony of jessicas capture and captivity the terror and disbelief that cascaded through an entire town at the news of her disappearance into enemy hands the joy of her rescue and the long work of healing and recovery that lie ahead jessica lynch has won the hearts and minds of americans in the hands of rick bragg a renowned chronicler of american lives her tale is told at last with grace and care and astonishing candorfrom the hardcover edition,7

Fed up with the fanny,"From Franklin White comes Fed Up with the Fanny, the story of Kahlil Richardson, a man with a great job who's socially responsible, devoted to family and friends, and, best of all, he's fine! There's just one problem...the women in his life:. Cece, Kahlil's true love, is ready to commit her life to her man, but when Kelly, Cece's best friend, misrepresents Kahlil's good intentions, a wedge is driven between the once-happy couple.

Leandra, Kahlil's sister, is forever dumping problems on him. She's spent her life manipulating those who care for her - including Sid, her troubled teenage son, and his father, whom she's kept hidden from everyone. Events spiral out of control within the family after Sid chooses to give his ""friends"" and their thug-life organization a chance instead of continuing to work at what he sees as a dead-end job.

Sonje, Kahlil's colleague and former lover, is hell-bent on advancing her career in the world of day time talk shows. She presents Kahlil and his hardworking community organization a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to display their accomplishments on national television, but when the tape starts to roll it's clear that Sonje has other motives.

Dewayna, Kahlil's close friend, is trying hard to raise her young son after Demitrious, her husband and the father of their child, deserts her without explanation. At Dewayna's request Kahlil tracks Demitrious down and tries to help his friends rebuild the joy they once shared.

Fed Up with the Fanny is a novel for every woman who's yearned for men to communicate more, and for every man who's felt blamed for the divide between the sexes.

Athens, Greece. As a Boeing 737 noses into its gate, its crew is suddenly confronted by Greek officials waiting to arrest one of its passengers, a beloved ex-president of the United States, John Harris. Believing Harris's life is in danger, Captain Craig Dayton stages a daring escape by backing the jet away from the gate without clearance and taking off down a vacant runway.

The Peruvian government alleges that Harris is personally responsible for a supposed CIA-led strike against a biological weapons factory during his term of office. But Harris's-and the U.S. State Department's-nightmare is this: There is no place to hide because every nation in the Pan-American federation has signed the treaty and any one of them must honor the warrant and give Peru what it wants: a presidential pawn to humiliate on the international stage.

As I Saw It,"When Dean Rusk became JFK's Secretary of State, he pledged never to write a memoir Strictly speaking, the elder statesman (now 81) has kept his promise. At any rate, the autobiographical recollections at hand were dictated to an adult son who put them into publishable form and added personal commentary that helps put the nominal author into human-scale focus. The man who emerges from the lengthy text nonetheless remains something of a mystery. A Georgia farm boy who compiled a long and largely distinguished record in public service, Rusk worked his way through Davidson and earned a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford. During WW II, he was an aide to General Joseph Stillwell in the CBI, moving later to the State Department, where he stayed after the war as an assistant secretary under George Marshall and Dean Acheson. Subsequently named president of the Rockefeller Foundation, Rusk returned in 1961 to Washington and stayed on through the LBJ Administration. The Vietnam War was the central issue of these divisive years, and Rusk eloquently argues the case for US military intervention. As with other turning-point events, however, he offers precious little idea of his own views. In consequence, Rusk seems more the good soldier, loyal to a fault, than the man of peace his post-government teaching career would suggest. In brief, then, a tantalizing testament from an American internationalist whose stubborn integrity and allegiances have gained him censure as well as honor.","['Biography', 'Foreign relations', 'Statesmen', 'Rusk, dean, 1909-1994', 'United states, foreign relations, 1961-1981']",['United States'],"['Dean Rusk (1909-)', 'Dean Rusk (1909-1994)']",['1945-1989'],,['OL17258A'],8,when dean rusk became jfks secretary of state he pledged never to write a memoir strictly speaking the elder statesman now 81 has kept his promise at any rate the autobiographical recollections at hand were dictated to an adult son who put them into publishable form and added personal commentary that helps put the nominal author into humanscale focus the man who emerges from the lengthy text nonetheless remains something of a mystery a georgia farm boy who compiled a long and largely distinguished record in public service rusk worked his way through davidson and earned a rhodes scholarship to oxford during ww ii he was an aide to general joseph stillwell in the cbi moving later to the state department where he stayed after the war as an assistant secretary under george marshall and dean acheson subsequently named president of the rockefeller foundation rusk returned in 1961 to washington and stayed on through the lbj administration the vietnam war was the central issue of these divisive years and rusk eloquently argues the case for us military intervention as with other turningpoint events however he offers precious little idea of his own views in consequence rusk seems more the good soldier loyal to a fault than the man of peace his postgovernment teaching career would suggest in brief then a tantalizing testament from an american internationalist whose stubborn integrity and allegiances have gained him censure as well as honor,14

The myth of analysis,"In this work, acclaimed Jungian James Hillman examines the concepts of myth, insights, eros, body, and the mytheme of female inferiority, as well as the need for the freedom to imagine and to feel psychic reality.

Land and Freedom,"""During the early nineteenth century, two million acres of New York's farmland were controlled by a handful of great families. Along the Hudson Valley and across the Catskills lay the great estates of the Van Rensselaers, the Livingstons, and a dozen lesser landlords. Some two hundred and sixty thousand men, women, and children - a twelfth of the population of New York, the nation's most populous state - worked this land as tenants.

Beginning in 1839, these tenants created a movement dedicated to destroying the estates and distributing the land to those who farmed it. The ""anti-rent"" movement quickly became one of the most powerful and influential popular movements of the antebellum era."".

""Deftly interweaving an engaging narrative history with broad-ranging social and political analysis, Land and Freedom brings to life the voices of antebellum northern farmers as they debated the critical social and political issues of their day. It grounds those debates in a detailed analysis of social and political change on New York's estates, and demonstrates the impact of farmers' ideas and initiatives on the broader social and political order.

KGB,"It was official. In 1991, two months after an abortive coup in August, the KGB was pronounced dead. But was it really? In KGB: Death and Rebirth, Martin Ebon, a writer long engaged in the study of foreign affairs, maintains that the notorious secret police/espionage organization is alive and well.

He takes a penetrating look at KGB predecessors, the KGB at the time of its supposed demise, and the subsequent use of segmented intelligence forces such as border patrols and communications and espionage agencies. Ebon points out that after the Ministry of Security resurrected these domestic KGB activities, Yevgeny Primakov's Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (FIS) assumed foreign policy positions not unlike its predecessor's.

Even more important, Ebon argues, spin-off secret police organizations - some still bearing the KGB name - have surfaced, wielding significant power in former Soviet republics, from the Ukraine to Kazakhstan, from Latvia to Georgia.

How did the new KGB evolve? Who were the individuals responsible for recreating the KGB in its new image? What was the KGB's relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev during his regime? Did Boris Yeltsin plan a Russian KGB, even before the August coup? What has been the role of KGB successor agencies within the independence movements in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia? How has Yevgeny Primakov influenced foreign intelligence activity? What is the role of the FIS in Iran? What does the future hold?

Martin Ebon meets these provocative questions head-on, offering candid, often surprising answers and new information for the curious - or concerned - reader. While the Cold War is over, Ebon cautions, the KGB has retained its basic structure and goals under a new name, and it would be naive to believe otherwise.","['Intelligence service', 'Sluzhba vneshneĭ razvedki Rossiĭskoĭ Federat︠s︡ii', 'History', 'Soviet Union.

A friend and inspiration to renowned designer Hubert de Givenchy, Audrey emerged as a fashion icon as well as a film legend, her influence on women's fashion virtually unparalleled to this day.But behind the glamorous public persona, Audrey Hepburn was both a different and a deeper person and a woman who craved love and affection. Donald Spoto offers remarkable insights into her professional and personal relationships with her two husbands, and with celebrities such as Gregory Peck, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Gary Cooper, Robert Anderson, Cary Grant, Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and Ben Gazzara. The turbulent romances of her youth, her profound sympathy for the plight of hungry children, and the thrills and terrors of motherhood prepared Audrey for the final chapter in her life, as she devoted herself entirely to the charity efforts of an organization that had once come to her rescue at the end of the war: UNICEF.Donald Spoto has written a poignant, funny and deeply moving biography of an unforgettable woman. At last, Enchantment reveals the private Audrey Hepburn--and invites readers to fall in love with her all over again.""She was as funny as she was beautiful. She was a magical combination of high chic and high spirits."" --Gregory Peck""In spite of her fragile appearance, she's like steel."" --Cary Grant""Audrey was known for something which has disappeared, and that is elegance, grace and manners . . .

**The moment he lays eyes on Kate, Dr. Rodney Prince is enchanted.** He senses in this poverty-stricken patient an intelligence and warmth that's completely unexpected. His own wife, living in the oblivion of velvet cushions and lavish dinner parties, seems crude by comparison. Though they meet only briefly then retreat to their separate worlds, the image of Kate leaves an indelible mark upon his mind.

**Rodney knows that Kate's spirit has survived life-long suffering at the hands of men.** Her father, an embittered dock worker, directed his violent rages toward Kate and her mother. At age eighteen Kate fell victim to a smooth-talking seducer and became the unwed mother of a child she later compromised her dignity to support. Such circumstances only deepen Rodney's desire to rescue Kate and overturn the codes of a society that serve to keep them apart. **As the kindhearted Dr. Prince unintentionally wins over the heart of Kate's fatherless daughter, he and Kate begin to acknowledge that the gap between rich and poor might not be so great after all.**

This Year Will Be Different,"From the New York Times bestselling author of Circle of Friends and The Glass Lake comes This Year It Will Be Different, a stunning new work that brings us the magic and spirit of Christmas in fifteen stories filled with Maeve Binchy's trademark wit, charm, and sheer storytelling genius. Instead of nostalgia, Binchy evokes contemporary life; instead of Christmas homilies, she offers truth; and instead of sugarplums, she brings us the nourishment of holidays that precipitate change, growth, and new beginnings.In ""A Typical Irish Christmas,"" a grieving New York widower heads for a holiday in Ireland and finds an unexpected destination not just for himself, but for a father and daughter at odds.  The title story ""This Year It Will Be Different"" also delves into the emotions of a person at mid-life--a woman with a complacent husband and grown children who are entering a season that can forever alter her life, and theirs.  In ""Pulling Together,"" a teacher not yet out of her twenties sees her affair with a married man at a turning point as Christmas Eve approaches--and she may be off on a new direction with some unusual friends.  And in the delightful tale ""The Hard Core,"" the four most recalcitrant residents of a nursing home are left alone at Christmas with the owner's daughter in charge: the result is sure to be disaster--or the kind of life-affirming renewal that only the spirit of the season can bring.The stories in This Year It Will Be Different powerfully evoke many lives--step-families grappling with ex's, long-married couples faced with in-law problems, a wandering husband choosing between ""the other woman"" and his wife, a child caught in grown-up tugs-of-war--during the one holiday when feelings cannot be easily hidden. The time of year may be magical, imbued with meaning. But the situations are universal. And Maeve Binchy makes us care about them all. As the Philadelphia Inquirer noted, ""Maeve Binchy's people come to life fully. They make you laugh and cry and disturb your sleep."" They do precisely that in this extraordinary collection, on the night before Christmas when we are snug in our beds, or anywhere, any time of the year.From the Hardcover edition.","['English Christmas stories', 'Fiction', 'Literature', 'Fiction, short stories (single author)', 'Fiction, christian, short stories', 'Large type books', 'Families', 'Introspection', 'Change', 'Irish authors', 'Short stories', 'Fiction, christian, general']",,,,,['OL21305A'],5,from the new york times bestselling author of circle of friends and the glass lake comes this year it will be different a stunning new work that brings us the magic and spirit of christmas in fifteen stories filled with maeve binchys trademark wit charm and sheer storytelling genius instead of nostalgia binchy evokes contemporary life instead of christmas homilies she offers truth and instead of sugarplums she brings us the nourishment of holidays that precipitate change growth and new beginningsin a typical irish christmas a grieving new york widower heads for a holiday in ireland and finds an unexpected destination not just for himself but for a father and daughter at odds the title story this year it will be different also delves into the emotions of a person at midlifea woman with a complacent husband and grown children who are entering a season that can forever alter her life and theirs in pulling together a teacher not yet out of her twenties sees her affair with a married man at a turning point as christmas eve approachesand she may be off on a new direction with some unusual friends and in the delightful tale the hard core the four most recalcitrant residents of a nursing home are left alone at christmas with the owners daughter in charge the result is sure to be disasteror the kind of lifeaffirming renewal that only the spirit of the season can bringthe stories in this year it will be different powerfully evoke many livesstepfamilies grappling with exs longmarried couples faced with inlaw problems a wandering husband choosing between the other woman and his wife a child caught in grownup tugsofwarduring the one holiday when feelings cannot be easily hidden the time of year may be magical imbued with meaning but the situations are universal and maeve binchy makes us care about them all as the philadelphia inquirer noted maeve binchys people come to life fully they make you laugh and cry and disturb your sleep they do precisely that in this extraordinary collection on the night before christmas when we are snug in our beds or anywhere any time of the yearfrom the hardcover edition,7

Gas kiln firing,"This is the 1999 edition of a book I wrote in 1975, first published by others. The nice thing about a field such as ceramics is that so little has changed over time.  Everything in the book is still valid. We still place clay into a box and apply enough heat to transform the clay into a ceramic. It is a science, but with some kilns it is an art, bordering on a miracle.
	So, what’s all the mystery? Some people can fire successfully and some can’t. Some kilns fire easily and some are stubborn or seem to ruin most of what is placed in them. All of this can be explained if you understand the firing process.
	That’s what this book is all about. Its purpose its to replace mystery with understanding. No more never-ending firings, or puzzles about something strange and unexplained happening.
	The other reason for the book is to conserve energy. Don’t get upset. By conserving energy, we make the craft affordable in this time of high energy prices, and thereby we prolong the craft and craftsperson. Conservation of energy also means less pollution because more or most of the fuel is burned and not belched into the atmosphere. With an ever increasing population, we all eat, breathe, smell, and live with someone else’s pollution. We cannot afford this.

Notes on nursing,"From the best-known work of Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), the originator and founder of modern nursing, comes a collection of notes that played an important part in the much-needed revolution in the field of nursing. For the first time it was brought to the attention of those caring for the sick that their responsibilities covered not only the administration of medicines and the application of poultices, but the proper use of fresh air, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and the proper selection and administration of diet. Miss Nightingale is outspoken on these subjects as well as on other factors that she considers essential to good nursing. But, whatever her topic, her main concern and attention is always on the patient and his needs. One is impressed with the fact that the fundamental needs of the sick as observed by Miss Nightingale are amazingly similar today (even though they are generally taken for granted now) to what they were over 100 years ago when this book was written. For this reason this little volume is as practical as it is interesting and entertaining. It will be an inspiration to the student nurse, refreshing and stimulating to the experienced nurse, and immensely helpful to anyone caring for the sick. - Back cover.

The following notes are by no means intended as a rule of thought by which nurses can teach themselves to nurse, still less as a manual to teach nurses to nurse. They are meant simply to give hints for thought to women who have personal charge of the health of others. Every woman, or at least almost every woman, in England has, at one time or another of her life, charge of the personal health of somebody, whether child or invalid -- in other words, every woman is a nurse. Every day sanitary knowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put the constitution in such as state as that it will have no disease, or that it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognized as the knowledge which every one ought to have -- distinct from medical knowledge, which only a profession can have. - Preface.","['Nursing', 'Caregivers', 'Nursing Care', 'Nurses', 'Nurses and nursing', 'Philosophy', 'Study and teaching', 'Practice', 'Medical care', 'Biography', 'Practical nursing', 'Vocational guidance', 'Nightingale model of nursing', 'History', 'Care of the sick', 'Nightingale, florence, 1820-1910']",,['Florence Nightingale (1820-1910)'],,,['OL35278A'],17,from the bestknown work of florence nightingale 18201910 the originator and founder of modern nursing comes a collection of notes that played an important part in the muchneeded revolution in the field of nursing for the first time it was brought to the attention of those caring for the sick that their responsibilities covered not only the administration of medicines and the application of poultices but the proper use of fresh air light warmth cleanliness quiet and the proper selection and administration of diet miss nightingale is outspoken on these subjects as well as on other factors that she considers essential to good nursing but whatever her topic her main concern and attention is always on the patient and his needs one is impressed with the fact that the fundamental needs of the sick as observed by miss nightingale are amazingly similar today even though they are generally taken for granted now to what they were over 100 years ago when this book was written for this reason this little volume is as practical as it is interesting and entertaining it will be an inspiration to the student nurse refreshing and stimulating to the experienced nurse and immensely helpful to anyone caring for the sick back cover the following notes are by no means intended as a rule of thought by which nurses can teach themselves to nurse still less as a manual to teach nurses to nurse they are meant simply to give hints for thought to women who have personal charge of the health of others every woman or at least almost every woman in england has at one time or another of her life charge of the personal health of somebody whether child or invalid in other words every woman is a nurse every day sanitary knowledge or the knowledge of nursing or in other words of how to put the constitution in such as state as that it will have no disease or that it can recover from disease takes a higher place it is recognized as the knowledge which every one ought to have distinct from medical knowledge which only a profession can have preface,4

The state must protect the individual's right to his person, property, reputation, and social relations. Building on his Theory of Moral Sentiments, Smith argues that the state must act as an impartial spectator, judging when an individual has been injured. The state must then design and apply civil and criminal laws to prevent further injuries and punish transgressors. Laws are also the means by which the state promotes public prosperity.

Coming to Terms,"Coming to Terms: South Africa's Search for Truth traces the history of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the country's quest for self-determination in its transition from authoritarian rule to participatory democracy. - Carnegie Corporation of New York.

Drawing on decades of experience in the country and on his extensive coverage of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Martin Meredith tells a vividly South African story. But the issues involved are also utterly universal. In Meredith's view, for all the truth commission's dramatic achievements (and they were many), it left South Africa ultimately unsatisfied. The political parties condemned its report; whites largely ignored its work; and many victims felt that it robbed them of traditional justice. All that is true, and yet, viewed in global context, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a huge achievement, and its impact may seem even greater as time goes on. For all the limitations of South Africa's truth commission, it seems to have been more successful than anything else yet tried, in part because its designers could learn from the mistakes of nations that had come before. - Foreword.","['Apartheid', 'Human rights', 'South Africa', 'South Africa.

News Values,"News Values is a concise, powerful statement of the fundamental issues, ethical and practical, confronting newspapers today. Chicago Tribune president and publisher Jack Fuller tackles the most pressing questions facing journalists in the nineties: What kind of truth do they claim to communicate? To what end? Should journalists lead or follow their communities? How are decisions about what makes ""news"" related to marketing? What is the future of newspapers?

Drawing on thirty years of experience, from police reporter to editorial writer, war correspondent to editor, Fuller looks at what journalism should do in a free society and why.

Focusing on tensions central to modern-day newspaper publishing - the duty to truth vs. the obligation to sources; the push for diversity vs. the need for coherence; the responsibility to reflect and, when necessary, oppose the community one serves - Fuller argues that intellectually honest ""news values"" do exist and can continue to guide journalists even in today's competitive marketplace.

Finally, Fuller examines advances in digital technology merging text, audio, and video and asks whether the new interactive electronic media will hasten newspapers' demise or stimulate their revival.","['Objectivity', 'Journalism', 'Journalistic ethics', 'Moral and ethical aspects', 'Moral and ethical aspects of Journalistic ethics', 'Journalism, objectivity']",,,,,['OL30965A'],6,news values is a concise powerful statement of the fundamental issues ethical and practical confronting newspapers today chicago tribune president and publisher jack fuller tackles the most pressing questions facing journalists in the nineties what kind of truth do they claim to communicate to what end should journalists lead or follow their communities how are decisions about what makes news related to marketing what is the future of newspapers drawing on thirty years of experience from police reporter to editorial writer war correspondent to editor fuller looks at what journalism should do in a free society and why focusing on tensions central to modernday newspaper publishing the duty to truth vs the obligation to sources the push for diversity vs the need for coherence the responsibility to reflect and when necessary oppose the community one serves fuller argues that intellectually honest news values do exist and can continue to guide journalists even in todays competitive marketplace finally fuller examines advances in digital technology merging text audio and video and asks whether the new interactive electronic media will hasten newspapers demise or stimulate their revival,4

Filled with explosive adventure, unforgettable characters, and authentic technology set against political scenarios so real they often anticipate world events, each of Dale Brown's novels is a major event. Now he returns to the airspace only he can truly call his own, in a blockbuster novel about a world on the brink of World War III and a new generation of brash young heroes...Patrick McLanahan is back. The veteran navigator-bombardier and brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force has been sent to a B-1B Lancer unit in Nevada to develop and train a tactical strike unit designed to seek out and destroy enemy missiles. He has his pick of the most aggressive Type A personalities in the flying game, though it may take years to pull this bunch of mavericks together to fight as a team.Then time runs out. The fragile peace in Asia is shattered when what was supposed to be a joint U.S.-Japan-South Korea mock bombing raid turns lethal. Instead of hewing to the script, South Korean fighter-bombers streak north to destroy several North Korean command-and-control, special forces, and secret police centers in support of a massive people's revolt against the Communist regime. To the world's surprise, the raids are a complete success. The North Korean military surrenders. The borders are thrown wide open and the United Republic of Korea is born.But this United Korea is also the world's newest nuclear power. It refuses to destroy thousands of captured nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, which it sees as potent protection against the massive threat of China to its north. Vowing never again to be anyone's puppet, it is ready to defy the United States and even attack China in order to preserve its sovereignty.Thus begins a conflict that threatens to embroil all of Asia. Enter McLanahan's raw, audacious team.

The Rock That Is Higher: Story as Truth

We are all strangers in a strange land, longing for home, but not quite knowing what or where home is. We glimpse it sometimes in our dreams, or as we turn a corner, and suddenly there is a strange, sweet familiarity that vanishes almost as soon as it comes… –Madeleine L’Engle, from The Rock That Is Higher

Story captures our hearts and feeds our imaginations. It reminds us who we are and where we came from. Story gives meaning and direction to our lives as we learn to see it as an affirmation of God’s love and truth–an acknowledgment of our longing for a rock in the midst of life’s wilderness.

Drawing upon her own experiences, well-known tales in literature, and selected narratives from Scripture, Madeleine L’Engle gently leads the way into the glorious world of story in The Rock That Is Higher. Here she acknowledges universal human longings and considers how literature, Scripture, personal stories, and life experiences all point us toward our true home.","['Religious aspects of Storytelling', 'Storytelling', 'Christianity', 'Meditations']",,"[""Madeleine L'Engle""]",,,"['OL28188A', 'OL8751412A']",8,the rock that is higher story as truth rate this book 1 of 5 stars 2 of 5 stars 3 of 5 stars 4 of 5 stars 5 of 5 stars open preview the rock that is higher story as truth by madeleine lengle 413 rating details 585 ratings 62 reviews we are all strangers in a strange land longing for home but not quite knowing what or where home is we glimpse it sometimes in our dreams or as we turn a corner and suddenly there is a strange sweet familiarity that vanishes almost as soon as it comes madeleine lengle from the rock that is higher story captures our hearts and feeds our imaginations it reminds us who we are and where we came from story gives meaning and direction to our lives as we learn to see it as an affirmation of gods love and truthan acknowledgment of our longing for a rock in the midst of lifes wilderness drawing upon her own experiences wellknown tales in literature and selected narratives from scripture madeleine lengle gently leads the way into the glorious world of story in the rock that is higher here she acknowledges universal human longings and considers how literature scripture personal stories and life experiences all point us toward our true home,7

Dog soldiers,"Written by Bernie Weisz Historian/Vietnam War Pembroke Pines, Florida U.S.A. contact:BernWei1@aol.com

Being a historian specializing in America involvement in Vietnam, I tried to take a break in reading nonfiction by delving into Robert Stone's ""Dog Soldiers"". Seeing Denzil Washington in the recent movie hit ""American Gangster"" piqued my curiosity in this novel. Besides, I needed a break from constantly reading nonfiction. Reading a novel allows the reader to absorb without constant attention to detail and historical connection. It is also proven to bring up one's reading speed. Thinking topics such as the Vietnam War, the heroin trade that existed during the Vietnam Conflict and CIA complicity in the trade I was expecting an exciting yarn. Regrettably, I was disappointed. I found the characters, in particular ""John Converse and his wife, Marge"", to be burnt-out losers. You can read other reviews to get an idea of what the plot is about, so without being a ""plot-spoiler"", I felt that with all the drugged-out corruptness, the infidelity of the protagonist's wife, the illogical decisions made by people bent on profiting by the sale of heroin, this book was a waste of time to read. In trying to get any connection to reality, there was the part early in the story where ""Converse"", the protagonist, justifies smuggling a couple of kilos from Vietnam into the U.S. by what follows. Stone wrote:""The last moral objection (to smuggling heroin) that Converse experienced in the traditional manner had been his reaction to the Great Elephant Zap of the previous year. That winter, the Military Advisory Command, Vietnam, had decided that elephants were enemy agents bevause the NVA used them to carry things, and there ensued a scene worthy of the Ramayana. Many-armed, hundred-headed MACV had sent forth steel-bodied flying insects (helicopter gunships) to destroy his enemies, the elephants. All over the country, whooping sweating gunners descended from the cloud cover to stampede the herds and mow them down with 7.62 millimeter machine guns. The Great Elephant Zap had been too much and had disgusted everyone. Even the chopper crews who remembered the day as one of insane exhileration had been somewhat appalled. There was a feeling that there were limits. And as for dope, Converse thought, and addicts-if the world is going to contain elephants pursued by flying men, people are just naturally going to want to get high. So there, Converse thought, that's the way it's done. He had confronted a moral objection and overridden it"". Obvoiusly, this twisted analogy to justify selling heroin made as little sense to me as the end of the story (what happens to the heroin and the people smuggling it). I need a story that has a semblence of logic, reality and historical connectedness, an attribute I felt ""Dog Soldiers"" lacked.","['Fiction', 'Journalists', 'Americans', 'Smuggling', 'Southeast Asia', 'Fiction, war & military', 'Journalists, fiction', 'Vietnam war, 1961-1975, fiction', 'California, fiction']","['Vietnam', 'California', 'Southeast Asia']",['Robert Stone'],"[""late 1960's""]",,['OL19663A'],10,written by bernie weisz historianvietnam war pembroke pines florida usa contactbernwei1aolcom being a historian specializing in america involvement in vietnam i tried to take a break in reading nonfiction by delving into robert stones dog soldiers seeing denzil washington in the recent movie hit american gangster piqued my curiosity in this novel besides i needed a break from constantly reading nonfiction reading a novel allows the reader to absorb without constant attention to detail and historical connection it is also proven to bring up ones reading speed thinking topics such as the vietnam war the heroin trade that existed during the vietnam conflict and cia complicity in the trade i was expecting an exciting yarn regrettably i was disappointed i found the characters in particular john converse and his wife marge to be burntout losers you can read other reviews to get an idea of what the plot is about so without being a plotspoiler i felt that with all the druggedout corruptness the infidelity of the protagonists wife the illogical decisions made by people bent on profiting by the sale of heroin this book was a waste of time to read in trying to get any connection to reality there was the part early in the story where converse the protagonist justifies smuggling a couple of kilos from vietnam into the us by what follows stone wrotethe last moral objection to smuggling heroin that converse experienced in the traditional manner had been his reaction to the great elephant zap of the previous year that winter the military advisory command vietnam had decided that elephants were enemy agents bevause the nva used them to carry things and there ensued a scene worthy of the ramayana manyarmed hundredheaded macv had sent forth steelbodied flying insects helicopter gunships to destroy his enemies the elephants all over the country whooping sweating gunners descended from the cloud cover to stampede the herds and mow them down with 762 millimeter machine guns the great elephant zap had been too much and had disgusted everyone even the chopper crews who remembered the day as one of insane exhileration had been somewhat appalled there was a feeling that there were limits and as for dope converse thought and addictsif the world is going to contain elephants pursued by flying men people are just naturally going to want to get high so there converse thought thats the way its done he had confronted a moral objection and overridden it obvoiusly this twisted analogy to justify selling heroin made as little sense to me as the end of the story what happens to the heroin and the people smuggling it i need a story that has a semblence of logic reality and historical connectedness an attribute i felt dog soldiers lacked,18

The Mysterious West,"Morris (American literature, Pennsylvania State Univ., Erie) conducted 15 interviews between 1988 and 1992 of authors writing primarily of the American West. The interviewees are all ""postmodernist"" and ""postregionalist"" in their perspectives, sharing an ambiguous and ambivalent attitude toward place and the mythos that represents it. Some of these writers still look to the past but reinterpret it, such as Ron Hansen, Molly Gloss, and Ivan Doig; others, like William Kittredge, seek to demythologize it. Among the writers interviewed are several female voices (Gloss, Gretel Ehrlich, and Mary Clearman Blew), who offer a new vision of the roles played by women in shaping the American West. All of them yield valuable insights into what direction the new Western literary tradition seems to be headed. Novelist Hillerman's volume, in contrast, is far less weighty. It contains 20 short stories, primarily mystery and detective fiction, such as Marcia Muller's ""Forbidden Things"" and Karen Kijewski's ""Tule Fog,"" interspersed with an occasional fantastical tale. The fictional landscapes here range from the desolation, silence, and danger of Death Valley, and the small, dying towns of southern Colorado to the sophisticated originality and zaniness of Berkekey, California. Across these pages march university protesters, ranch hands, and Yurok Indians. Together, they give life to a multifaceted landscape that is currently undergoing redefinition, as Morris's volume of interviews amply demonstrates. There is no overlap between the writers in these two works. For this reason, owning both works would give a novice reader of Western literature a useful variety.

So when a smooth-talking scoundrel comes to camp, no one is ready to listen to Bannon’s warning. He alone knows that Mort Harper’s route leads to certain massacre. Now it is up to Bannon to protect the greenhorn settlers–especially the beautiful Sharon Crockett–and convince them of the truth about Harper before it is too late. For even if the wagon train survives the hostile Indians and desert ahead, it is bound for Bishop’s Valley and a vicious land war–a war that will force Bannon to oppose the innocent settlers.

Sandino's daughters,"First published in 1981 in the wake of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) revolution in Nicaragua, Sandino's Daughters can now be seen not as a triumph of revolutionary ideals, but as a triumph of the spirit. Through a series of interviews with participants at all levels in the resistance, Margaret Randall recounts the lives of ordinary women who became pillars of strength and perseverance during their decades-long involvement in the Sandinista struggle against the Somoza dictatorship.

Believing firmly that women's liberation was inextricably linked with national liberation, many of these women were in the vanguard of the movement inspired by Augusto Sandino. At the peak of revolutionary activity, women from all classes and backgrounds comprised 30 percent of the Sandinista army. For many of these women, politics became one with the personal.

Hindsight perhaps offers the greatest irony of the women's alliance with the FSLN in the fact that it was a woman, Violeta Chamorro, who challenged and defeated the Sandinistas in the free elections of 1990. Though lured by the revolutionary quixotism of a promise that lasted slightly more than a decade, the women of Sandino's Daughters will stand as a monument to all those who yearn to be free.","['Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional', 'Women soldiers', 'Women and socialism', 'Interviews', 'History', 'Women, nicaragua', 'Nicaragua, social conditions', 'Frente sandinista de liberacion nacional', 'Politics and government', 'Women', 'Women guerrillas', 'Biography', 'Femmes', 'Biographies', 'Histoire', 'Uprising (Nicaragua : 1978) fast (OCoLC)fst01355238', 'Guerrillas', 'Political activity']",['Nicaragua'],,"['Uprising, 1978', '1937-1979', 'Revolution, 1979']",1981,"['OL1330611A', 'OL15629A', 'OL2895222A']",10,first published in 1981 in the wake of the sandinista national liberation front fsln revolution in nicaragua sandinos daughters can now be seen not as a triumph of revolutionary ideals but as a triumph of the spirit through a series of interviews with participants at all levels in the resistance margaret randall recounts the lives of ordinary women who became pillars of strength and perseverance during their decadeslong involvement in the sandinista struggle against the somoza dictatorship believing firmly that womens liberation was inextricably linked with national liberation many of these women were in the vanguard of the movement inspired by augusto sandino at the peak of revolutionary activity women from all classes and backgrounds comprised 30 percent of the sandinista army for many of these women politics became one with the personal hindsight perhaps offers the greatest irony of the womens alliance with the fsln in the fact that it was a woman violeta chamorro who challenged and defeated the sandinistas in the free elections of 1990 though lured by the revolutionary quixotism of a promise that lasted slightly more than a decade the women of sandinos daughters will stand as a monument to all those who yearn to be free,14
Eaters of the Dead,"Eaters of the Dead: The Manuscript of Ibn Fadlan Relating His Experiences with the Northmen in AD 922 (later republished as The 13th Warrior to correspond with the film adaptation of the novel) is a 1976 novel by Michael Crichton, the fourth novel under his own name and his 14th overall. The story is about a 10th-century Muslim Arab who travels with a group of Vikings to their settlement.

Crichton explains in an appendix that the book was based on two sources. The first three chapters are a retelling of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's personal account of his actual journey north and his experiences with and observations of Varangians. The remainder is a retelling of Beowulf.

He had lately been jilted, and one night a friend found an open note on the poor fellow's bed, in which he stated that he could no longer endure life and had drowned himself in Bear Creek. The friend ran down there and discovered Higgins wading back to shore. He had concluded he wouldn't. The village was full of it for several days, but Higgins did not suspect it. I thought this was a fine opportunity. I wrote an elaborately wretched account of the whole matter, and then illustrated it with villanous cuts engraved on the bottoms of wooden type with a jack-knife—one of them a picture of Higgins wading out into the creek in his shirt, with a lantern, sounding the depth of the water with a walking-stick.

Ludwig Wittgenstein,"Ludwig Wittgenstein is perhaps the greatest philosopher of the twentieth century, and certainly one of the most original in the entire Western tradition. Given the inaccessibility of his work, it is remarkable that he has inspired poems, paintings, films, musical compositions, titles of books -- and even novels. In his splendid biography, Ray Monk has made this very compelling human being come alive in a way that perfectly explains the fascination he has evoked. Wittgenstein's life was one of great moral and spiritual depth. Although his work addresses problems of logic, language, mind, and knowledge, he often described it as having an ethical point, and once said that he ""could not help seeing every problem from a religious point of view."" In successfully bridging the gap assumed by many to exist between Wittgenstein's life and his work, Monk's biography helps to explain the interest in Wittgenstein's later philosophy on the part of Buddhist scholars.","['Philosophers', 'Austria', 'Great Britain', 'Biography', 'Wittgenstein, ludwig, 1889-1951', 'Philosophy']","['Austria', 'Great Britain']",['Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951)'],,,['OL23539A'],10,ludwig wittgenstein is perhaps the greatest philosopher of the twentieth century and certainly one of the most original in the entire western tradition given the inaccessibility of his work it is remarkable that he has inspired poems paintings films musical compositions titles of books and even novels in his splendid biography ray monk has made this very compelling human being come alive in a way that perfectly explains the fascination he has evoked wittgensteins life was one of great moral and spiritual depth although his work addresses problems of logic language mind and knowledge he often described it as having an ethical point and once said that he could not help seeing every problem from a religious point of view in successfully bridging the gap assumed by many to exist between wittgensteins life and his work monks biography helps to explain the interest in wittgensteins later philosophy on the part of buddhist scholars,4

The exultet in Southern Italy,"The beautifully worked Exultet scrolls of southern Italy unite music, liturgical text, and image for use in a ceremonial blessing of the great Easter candle. Much was uncommon about this solemn rite, and from a perspective a millennium or so removed in time, the ritual and its magnificent documents appear unusual to the point of mystery. Why, for example, did it fall to the deacon and not his superior the bishop to conduct the Exultet ceremony?

And why on many of the later surviving documents were the pictures turned upside-down in relation to the text? Finally, and most basically, why produce these documents at all? What does it mean to 'lavish such care and talent on manuscripts to be used but once a year?

.

Addressing these and other questions, The Exultet in Southern Italy provides a meticulous and uniquely comprehensive study of this fascinating early medieval phenomenon. Where previous treatments have tended to focus on the illustrations, this impressively researched volume looks at the Exultet in full, from the painstaking manufacture of the rolls to the melodic structure of the songs to specific features of the rite and its placement in the Easter vigil service.

Offering a remarkable wealth of detail, the book pays equal attention to broad cultural and historical considerations, tracing in its subject a rich convergence of Byzantine, Roman, Lombard, and Norman influences while exploring the way changes in the ceremony reflect transformations in church organization and regional governance.","['Catholic Church', 'Catholic Church.

Patrick O'Brian,"In 1991, when The New York Times Book Review proclaimed Patrick O'Brian the writer of ""the greatest historical novels ever written,"" making him an overnight sensation in the United States, O'Brian was already in his mid-70s and had already had two distinct and remarkable writing careers. In less than a decade, O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, ultimately 20 novels strong, became an unprecedented literary juggernaut, with legions of devoted fans around America and around the world. With O'Brian's death in January 2000, curiosity about the carefully guarded secrets of his life has peaked. Here, Dean King tells the story of a man, an artist and an intellectual, born Richard Patrick Russ, who first achieves literary recognition as an adolescent, when he publishes a series of popular adventure stories. After the Second World War, he emerges as Patrick O'Brian, a writer of dark, sometimes tortured short stories and highly literary novels. He enjoys success as a translator, even as a biographer. Slowly, the O'Brian persona, forged in his own imagination and refined by years of rumor and speculation, takes form, until his ultimate triumphant arrival as a masterful historical novelist and chronicler of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars. O'Brian's past -- both real and imagined -- is linked directly to his writing, as he drew deeply on the painful events of his early life. It has long been assumed that he himself was the model for the polymathic naval surgeon and intelligence agent Stephen Maturin, who, along with rough-and-tumble Captain Jack Aubrey, forms the heart of O'Brian's monumental roman-fleuve. The truth is more complex: each of these indelible characters is wholly original, yet in each we can hear deep echoes of O'Brian's own history. King's biography, the first ever of this famously secretive man, is an extraordinary achievement, a vivid, searing portrait of an intense and complex human being, whose grudges were as fiercely held as his loyalties; who was as famous for orneriness as he was for brilliant artistic creation; and whose encyclopedic knowledge of everything from ornithology to Catalan history delighted hundreds of thousands of readers and will surely enthrall generations to come. - Jacket flap.","['Novelists, English', 'English Novelists', '20th century', 'Sea stories', 'Historical fiction', 'Authorship', 'Biography', ""O'brian, patrick, 1914-2000"", 'Authors, english']",,"[""Patrick O'Brian (1914-)"", ""Patrick O'Brian (1914-2000)""]",['20th century'],,['OL31361A'],10,in 1991 when the new york times book review proclaimed patrick obrian the writer of the greatest historical novels ever written making him an overnight sensation in the united states obrian was already in his mid70s and had already had two distinct and remarkable writing careers in less than a decade obrians aubreymaturin series ultimately 20 novels strong became an unprecedented literary juggernaut with legions of devoted fans around america and around the world with obrians death in january 2000 curiosity about the carefully guarded secrets of his life has peaked here dean king tells the story of a man an artist and an intellectual born richard patrick russ who first achieves literary recognition as an adolescent when he publishes a series of popular adventure stories after the second world war he emerges as patrick obrian a writer of dark sometimes tortured short stories and highly literary novels he enjoys success as a translator even as a biographer slowly the obrian persona forged in his own imagination and refined by years of rumor and speculation takes form until his ultimate triumphant arrival as a masterful historical novelist and chronicler of the royal navy during the napoleonic wars obrians past both real and imagined is linked directly to his writing as he drew deeply on the painful events of his early life it has long been assumed that he himself was the model for the polymathic naval surgeon and intelligence agent stephen maturin who along with roughandtumble captain jack aubrey forms the heart of obrians monumental romanfleuve the truth is more complex each of these indelible characters is wholly original yet in each we can hear deep echoes of obrians own history kings biography the first ever of this famously secretive man is an extraordinary achievement a vivid searing portrait of an intense and complex human being whose grudges were as fiercely held as his loyalties who was as famous for orneriness as he was for brilliant artistic creation and whose encyclopedic knowledge of everything from ornithology to catalan history delighted hundreds of thousands of readers and will surely enthrall generations to come jacket flap,3

Long Spoon Lane,"Anne Perry's bestselling Victorian novels offer readers an elixir as addictively rich as Devonshire cream or English ale--enticing millions into a literary world almost as real as the original. While flower sellers, costermongers, shopkeepers, and hansom drivers ply their trades, the London police watch over all. Or so people believe. . . .Early one morning, Thomas Pitt, dauntless mainstay of the Special Branch, is summoned to Long Spoon Lane, where anarchists are plotting an attack. Bombs explode, destroying the homes of many poor people. After a chase, two of the culprits are captured and the leader is shot . . . but by whom?As Pitt delves into the case, he finds that there is more to the terrorism than the destructive gestures of misguided idealists. The police are running a lucrative protection racket, and clues suggest that Inspector Wetron of Bow Street is the mastermind. As the shadowy leader of the Inner Circle, Wetron is using his influence with the press to whip up fears of more attacks--and to rush a bill through Parliament that would severely curtail civil liberties. This would make him the most powerful man in the country.To defeat Wetron, Pitt finds that he must run in harness with his old enemy, Sir Charles Voisey, and the unlikely allies are joined by Pitt's clever wife, Charlotte, and her great aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould. Can they prevail? As they strive to prevent future destruction, nothing less than the fate of the British Empire hangs in precarious balance.From the first sentence to the last, Long Spoon Lane is a miracle of suspense, of plot and counterplot, bluff and counterbluff, in a take-no-prisoners battle between good and evil. It is possibly the very best of all the wonderful Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels.From the Hardcover edition.","['Fiction', 'Thomas Pitt (Fictitious character)', 'Charlotte Pitt (Fictitious character)', 'Police', 'Anarchists', 'Police spouses', 'Bombings', 'History', 'Murder', 'Investigation', 'Women detectives', 'Detective and mystery stories', 'Historical Fiction', 'Mystery', 'Large type books', 'Pitt, thomas (fictitious character), fiction', 'Pitt, charlotte (fictitious character), fiction', 'London (england), fiction', 'Fiction, historical, general', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, general', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, traditional']","['England', 'London', 'London (England)', 'Great Britain']",,"['Victoria, 1837-1901']",,['OL25148A'],11,anne perrys bestselling victorian novels offer readers an elixir as addictively rich as devonshire cream or english aleenticing millions into a literary world almost as real as the original while flower sellers costermongers shopkeepers and hansom drivers ply their trades the london police watch over all or so people believe early one morning thomas pitt dauntless mainstay of the special branch is summoned to long spoon lane where anarchists are plotting an attack bombs explode destroying the homes of many poor people after a chase two of the culprits are captured and the leader is shot but by whomas pitt delves into the case he finds that there is more to the terrorism than the destructive gestures of misguided idealists the police are running a lucrative protection racket and clues suggest that inspector wetron of bow street is the mastermind as the shadowy leader of the inner circle wetron is using his influence with the press to whip up fears of more attacksand to rush a bill through parliament that would severely curtail civil liberties this would make him the most powerful man in the countryto defeat wetron pitt finds that he must run in harness with his old enemy sir charles voisey and the unlikely allies are joined by pitts clever wife charlotte and her great aunt lady vespasia cumminggould can they prevail as they strive to prevent future destruction nothing less than the fate of the british empire hangs in precarious balancefrom the first sentence to the last long spoon lane is a miracle of suspense of plot and counterplot bluff and counterbluff in a takenoprisoners battle between good and evil it is possibly the very best of all the wonderful charlotte and thomas pitt novelsfrom the hardcover edition,6

Hidden Cities,"Few realize that some of the oldest, largest, and most complex structures of ancient archaeology were built of earth, clay, and stone right here in America, in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. From 6,000 years ago until quite recently, North America was home to some of the most highly advanced and well organized civilizations in the world - complete with cities, roads, and commerce.

From the lost city of Balbantsha, near New Orleans, to the Great Hopewell Road, a causeway for religious pilgrims along the Ohio River in the thirteenth century, these cultures built hundreds of thousands of structures, of which a small but tantalizing portion still remain. Like the Druids of Salisbury Plain, they patterned extraordinarily precise geometry according to the rising and setting of the moon. Like the ancient Egyptians, they organized millions of hours of human labor to construct pyramids, platforms, and plazas. In Hidden Cities, Roger G.

Kennedy sets out on a bold quest of recovery - a recovery of the rich heritage of the North American peoples, and a reimagination of the true relations of their modern-day successors and neighbors.

From the Spanish and French explorers to the present, very few Euro-Americans have paid attention to the evidence and meaning of this heritage. Building on recent work of many archaeologists and historians, Roger Kennedy presents a fascinating picture of these American antiquities as well as their reception among leading citizens of the young United States.

On missions of exploration, politics, and even piracy, men such as George Rogers Clark, George Washington, Albert Gallatin, and Thomas Jefferson frequently chanced upon the architecture of the past. As Kennedy shows us the magnificence of the mound-building cultures through the sometimes-prejudiced eyes of the Founding generation, he reveals not only the astounding history of our continent, but also the reasons why we have refused to credit Native American predecessors with the greatness they deserve.","['Indians of North America', 'Mound-builders', 'Indianists', 'Antiquities', 'Architecture', 'Archaeologists', 'History', 'Indian architecture', 'Biography', 'Bouwkunst', 'Cultuurgeschiedenis', 'Indianen', 'Fiction, general']",['United States'],,,,['OL23462A'],10,few realize that some of the oldest largest and most complex structures of ancient archaeology were built of earth clay and stone right here in america in the ohio and mississippi valleys from 6000 years ago until quite recently north america was home to some of the most highly advanced and well organized civilizations in the world complete with cities roads and commerce from the lost city of balbantsha near new orleans to the great hopewell road a causeway for religious pilgrims along the ohio river in the thirteenth century these cultures built hundreds of thousands of structures of which a small but tantalizing portion still remain like the druids of salisbury plain they patterned extraordinarily precise geometry according to the rising and setting of the moon like the ancient egyptians they organized millions of hours of human labor to construct pyramids platforms and plazas in hidden cities roger g kennedy sets out on a bold quest of recovery a recovery of the rich heritage of the north american peoples and a reimagination of the true relations of their modernday successors and neighbors from the spanish and french explorers to the present very few euroamericans have paid attention to the evidence and meaning of this heritage building on recent work of many archaeologists and historians roger kennedy presents a fascinating picture of these american antiquities as well as their reception among leading citizens of the young united states on missions of exploration politics and even piracy men such as george rogers clark george washington albert gallatin and thomas jefferson frequently chanced upon the architecture of the past as kennedy shows us the magnificence of the moundbuilding cultures through the sometimesprejudiced eyes of the founding generation he reveals not only the astounding history of our continent but also the reasons why we have refused to credit native american predecessors with the greatness they deserve,18

Wolves of the Calla,"[The Dark Tower][1] V

After escaping the perilous wreckage of Blaine the insane Mono and eluding the evil clutches of the vindictive sorcerer Randall Flagg, Roland and his ka-tet find themselves back on the southeasterly path of the Beam. Here, in the borderlands that lie between Mid-World and End-World, Roland and his friends are approached by a frightened band of representatives from the nearby town of Calla Bryn Sturgis. In less than a month, the Calla will be attacked by the Wolves--those masked riders that gallop out of Thunderclap once a generation to steal the town's children. The Calla folken need the kind of help that only gunslingers can give, and if the tet agrees to help, the town's priest--Father Callahan, once of 'Salem's Lot, Maine--promises to give them Black Thirteen, the most potent and treacherous of Maerlyn's magic balls. He used it to enter Mid-World, and now it sleeps fitfully beneath the floorboards of his church. Meanwhile, in the New York of 1977, the Sombra Corporation plots to destroy the lot at Second Avenue and Forty-Sixth Street. How can Roland and his friends both save the rose and fight the Wolves? Only by using the magic of Black Thirteen, but how can anyone trust this sinister and treacherous object which is, in actuality, the eye of the Crimson King himself? Time is running out on all levels of the Tower, but unless our ka-tet can defeat the minions of Thunderclap both in our world and in Mid-World, they will never reach that great lynchpin of the time/space continuum which, even now, begins to totter . . .

Almost Midnight,"The haunting true story of a triple murder in the Ozarks, two lovers on the lam, and a death-row inmate saved by the pope. On a spring day more than ten years ago, sixty-nine-year-old Lloyd Lawrence was gunned down in rural Missouri. The shooter also turned his twelve-gauge shotgun on Lawrence's wife and their paraplegic grandson. The crime took place in a region known mostly for Pentecostal fervor, country music, and family-friendly tourism. But soon the murders would expose a dark underbelly in the Ozarks: Lloyd Lawrence was a notoriously violent crystal-meth kingpin, killed by an aspiring drug dealer named Darrell Mease.Capturing the raw circumstances that took Mease from his clean-cut youth to the front lines of Vietnam and an aftermath of drug use, Almost Midnight unites an unforgettable range of characters in some of America's most peculiar locales. When Mease and his girlfriend fled to the Southwest on a hair-raising road trip, this only brought Mease closer to death row. After his conviction, he claimed to receive a religious revelation guaranteeing that his life would be saved by miraculous intervention, a long-shot prediction that came true. A bizarre twist of fate brought Pope John Paul II to Saint Louis, where he pleaded with Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan to commute the sentence just months before Carnahan's fatal plane crash. In a triumph of investigative journalism, Michael Cuneo gained unprecedented access to Mease and immersed himself in the culture of the Ozarks, exploring its bucolic farms and seedy strip joints, and the lives of its preachers, cockfighters, and outlaws. By turns chilling and riveting, Almost Midnight brilliantly evokes the life of controversial renegade Mease, and the stranger-than-fiction world he still inhabits.","['Religion & Spirituality', 'True Crime', 'Nonfiction', 'Homicide', 'Case studies', 'Murderers', 'Travel', 'Death row inmates', 'Biography', 'Murder, united states']",,,,,['OL23954A'],7,the haunting true story of a triple murder in the ozarks two lovers on the lam and a deathrow inmate saved by the pope on a spring day more than ten years ago sixtynineyearold lloyd lawrence was gunned down in rural missouri the shooter also turned his twelvegauge shotgun on lawrences wife and their paraplegic grandson the crime took place in a region known mostly for pentecostal fervor country music and familyfriendly tourism but soon the murders would expose a dark underbelly in the ozarks lloyd lawrence was a notoriously violent crystalmeth kingpin killed by an aspiring drug dealer named darrell measecapturing the raw circumstances that took mease from his cleancut youth to the front lines of vietnam and an aftermath of drug use almost midnight unites an unforgettable range of characters in some of americas most peculiar locales when mease and his girlfriend fled to the southwest on a hairraising road trip this only brought mease closer to death row after his conviction he claimed to receive a religious revelation guaranteeing that his life would be saved by miraculous intervention a longshot prediction that came true a bizarre twist of fate brought pope john paul ii to saint louis where he pleaded with missouri governor mel carnahan to commute the sentence just months before carnahans fatal plane crash in a triumph of investigative journalism michael cuneo gained unprecedented access to mease and immersed himself in the culture of the ozarks exploring its bucolic farms and seedy strip joints and the lives of its preachers cockfighters and outlaws by turns chilling and riveting almost midnight brilliantly evokes the life of controversial renegade mease and the strangerthanfiction world he still inhabits,6

Reviving Ophelia,"Everybody who has survived adolescence knows what a scary, tumultuous, exciting time it is. But if we use memories of our experiences to guide our understanding of what today's girls are living through, we make a serious mistake. Our daughters are living in a new world.

Reviving Ophelia is a call to arms from Dr. Mary Pipher, a psychologist who has worked with teenagers for more than a decade. She finds that in spite of the women's movement, which has empowered adult women in some ways, teenage girls today are having a harder time than ever before because of higher levels of violence and sexism.

The current crises of adolescence - frequent suicide attempts, dropping out of school and running away from home, teenage pregnancies in unprecedented numbers, and an epidemic of eating disorders - are caused not so much by ""dysfunctional families"" or incorrect messages from parents as by our media-saturated, lookist, girl-destroying culture. Young teenagers are not developmentally equipped to meet the challenges that confront them.

Adolescence in America has traditionally involved breaking away from parents, experimenting with the trappings of adult life, and searching for autonomy and independence. Today's teenagers face serious pressures at an earlier age than that at which teenagers in the past did. The innocent act of attending an unsupervised party can lead to acquaintance rape. Having a boyfriend means dealing with sexual pressures, and often leads to pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted diseases.

It's no wonder that girls' math scores plummet and depression levels rise when they reach junior high. As they encounter situations that are simply too complex for them to handle, their self-esteem crumbles.

. The dangers young women face today can jeopardize their futures. It is critical that we understand the circumstances and take measures to correct them. We need to make that precious age of experimentation safe for adolescent girls. Reading Reviving Ophelia is the first step to doing so. Dr. Pipher offers not only a fresh and startling view of the problems but a clear and sane way to implement solutions.","['Case studies', 'Teenage girls', 'Psychology', 'Self-esteem in adolescence', 'Family relationships', 'Adolescent psychology', 'Women', 'Jongeren', 'Teenagers', 'Self Concept', 'Self-esteem', 'Girls', 'Adolescent girls', 'Self-esteem in women']",,,,,['OL34394A'],10,everybody who has survived adolescence knows what a scary tumultuous exciting time it is but if we use memories of our experiences to guide our understanding of what todays girls are living through we make a serious mistake our daughters are living in a new world reviving ophelia is a call to arms from dr mary pipher a psychologist who has worked with teenagers for more than a decade she finds that in spite of the womens movement which has empowered adult women in some ways teenage girls today are having a harder time than ever before because of higher levels of violence and sexism the current crises of adolescence frequent suicide attempts dropping out of school and running away from home teenage pregnancies in unprecedented numbers and an epidemic of eating disorders are caused not so much by dysfunctional families or incorrect messages from parents as by our mediasaturated lookist girldestroying culture young teenagers are not developmentally equipped to meet the challenges that confront them adolescence in america has traditionally involved breaking away from parents experimenting with the trappings of adult life and searching for autonomy and independence todays teenagers face serious pressures at an earlier age than that at which teenagers in the past did the innocent act of attending an unsupervised party can lead to acquaintance rape having a boyfriend means dealing with sexual pressures and often leads to pregnancy andor sexually transmitted diseases its no wonder that girls math scores plummet and depression levels rise when they reach junior high as they encounter situations that are simply too complex for them to handle their selfesteem crumbles the dangers young women face today can jeopardize their futures it is critical that we understand the circumstances and take measures to correct them we need to make that precious age of experimentation safe for adolescent girls reading reviving ophelia is the first step to doing so dr pipher offers not only a fresh and startling view of the problems but a clear and sane way to implement solutions,7
Berlin diary,"Essential Historic Document.  This is a most important historic document as it is the only known diary written by a professional journalist while on assignment in nazi Germany from 1933 to 1941.  Prior to this, Bill Shirer was on assignment in Paris.  There is no other Book I know that provides a better description of Germany's transformation from an essentially western democratic nation to  a nazi gangster society.  Many historians wonder 'how could this happen'?  William Shirer answers this question.  This is not an amateur diary and Shirer understood during the writing that it would become an important historic document. He was in the belly of the beast for all the important transformative years -1933 to 1941.  He displayed great bravery by staying to the last minute. He was also a master at keeping the nazis from deporting him yet also reporting the factual news.  —A juggling act that has never been matched.  We owe much to William Shirer.

Los Angeles,"It is a hoarse whisper over a crackling cell phone - ""Angel"" - and then the connection is lost. Angel is convinced that the voice belongs to his beautiful and enigmatic neighbor, Angela - and that she is terrified for her life. He paces the floor, waiting for the phone to ring again, calls the police, searches her apartment, but there is no trace of her anywhere, not for days. So begins a haunted man's quest to uncover what happened to the woman he has fallen in love with. Only now does he realize that he knows nearly nothing about her. Angel has his secrets, too. He is the son of one of Hollywood's most successful movie producers, but he has turned away from that bright and power-ridden world. Instead, he leads a cloistered existence, nursing an unfinished screenplay as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner loops ceaselessly in his darkened apartment. But now, for the first time in years, because of Angela's sudden disappearance, Angel is propelled into action. Following the few clues he has gathered about her, he trails Angela through the hard glitter of Los Angeles days and nights. With every new piece of knowledge arrives another question and an even more chilling possibility: Did he merely imagine Angela? Is someone deliberately leading him? Is the phantom he is pursuing the very fear he has been running from? In the murky underworld beneath the bright surface of Los Angeles, everything he knew about her - and himself - begins to unravel. In this city of secrets that aren't meant to be told and people who aren't meant to be found, Angel may soon discover that the most dangerous lies of all are the ones you tell yourself.","['Fiction', 'Suspense', 'Missing persons', 'Fiction, psychological', 'Los angeles (calif.), fiction', 'Fiction, thrillers, suspense', 'Missing persons, fiction']",['Los Angeles (Calif.)'],,,,['OL31625A'],9,it is a hoarse whisper over a crackling cell phone angel and then the connection is lost angel is convinced that the voice belongs to his beautiful and enigmatic neighbor angela and that she is terrified for her life he paces the floor waiting for the phone to ring again calls the police searches her apartment but there is no trace of her anywhere not for days so begins a haunted mans quest to uncover what happened to the woman he has fallen in love with only now does he realize that he knows nearly nothing about her angel has his secrets too he is the son of one of hollywoods most successful movie producers but he has turned away from that bright and powerridden world instead he leads a cloistered existence nursing an unfinished screenplay as ridley scotts blade runner loops ceaselessly in his darkened apartment but now for the first time in years because of angelas sudden disappearance angel is propelled into action following the few clues he has gathered about her he trails angela through the hard glitter of los angeles days and nights with every new piece of knowledge arrives another question and an even more chilling possibility did he merely imagine angela is someone deliberately leading him is the phantom he is pursuing the very fear he has been running from in the murky underworld beneath the bright surface of los angeles everything he knew about her and himself begins to unravel in this city of secrets that arent meant to be told and people who arent meant to be found angel may soon discover that the most dangerous lies of all are the ones you tell yourself,6

Textual politics from slavery to postcolonialism,"""Textual Politics from Slavery to Postcolonialism explores questions of race and identification from slavery to the so-called postcolonial present through close readings of texts by Olaudah Equiano, Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Jean Rhys, Frantz Fanon, Toni Morrison and Tsitsi Dangarembga.

Carl Plasa draws attention to the larger networks of dialogue and contestation in which those texts are located: Equiano writes back to an Enlightenment ideology of race as Dangarembga reworks the figurings of the white female body in Charlotte Bronte. Bronte is situated, in turn, between Austen and Rhys, in a narrative of colonial and postcolonial textual responses. Similarly, Morrison, and Dangarembga again, engage, implicity and explicitly, with the work of Fanon, while at the same time complicating his male-centred critique from African American and African feminist perspectives.

In analysis of Lee's generalship, Palmer forcefully argues that the celebrated leader had a penchant for hastily planned offensives undertaken with virtually no logistical preparation.

Drawing on extensive documentation, including Lee's personal correspondence, Michael Palmer focuses on the crucial period between September 1862 and November 1863 - specifically, three decisive campaigns: the abortive Maryland invasion that ended at Sharpsburg, the landmark battle of Gettysburg, and the lesser-known Bristoe Station fiasco that came shortly thereafter. As he vividly recreates the battles and maneuvers, Palmer offers new interpretations of several hotly debated episodes, including J. E.

B. ""Jeb"" Stuart's infamous ride around the Federal army during the Gettysburg campaign. Was the alternate plan outlined by Lee in fact unworkable?

Lee Moves North reveals how the general's penchant for secrecy about his plans - a prerequisite for the political battle he waged with his superiors in Richmond - undermined the Army of Northern Virginia. Keeping his true intentions hidden from President Jefferson Davis and Secretary of War James Seddon meant also keeping the plans secret from even the army's trusted corps commanders.

As a result, inadequate support, poor or nonexistent staff work, and confusion about campaign objectives all contributed to failure. In fact, Palmer's account demonstrates a direct correlation between the troubled relationship of Lee and Davis and the actual outcome on the battlefield.","['United States Civil War, 1861-1865', 'Campaigns', 'United States', 'Military leadership', 'Command of troops', 'History', 'Lee, robert e.

Contested Will,"For more than two hundred years after William Shakespeare's death, no one doubted that he had written his plays. Since then, however, dozens of candidates have been proposed for the authorship of what is generally agreed to be the finest body of work by a writer in the English language. In this remarkable book, Shakespeare scholar James Shapiro explains when and why so many people began to question whether Shakespeare wrote his plays. Among the doubters have been such writers and thinkers as Sigmund Freud, Henry James, Mark Twain, and Helen Keller. It is a fascinating story, replete with forgeries, deception, false claimants, ciphers and codes, conspiracy theories -- and a stunning failure to grasp the power of the imagination. As Contested Will makes clear, much more than proper attribution of Shakespeare's plays is at stake in this authorship controversy. Underlying the arguments over whether Christopher Marlowe, Francis Bacon, or the Earl of Oxford wrote Shakespeare's plays are fundamental questions about literary genius, specifically about the relationship of life and art. Are the plays (and poems) of Shakespeare a sort of hidden autobiography? Do Hamlet, Macbeth, and the other great plays somehow reveal who wrote them? Shapiro is the first Shakespeare scholar to examine the authorship controversy and its history in this way, explaining what it means, why it matters, and how it has persisted despite abundant evidence that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him. This is a brilliant historical investigation that will delight anyone interested in Shakespeare and the literary imagination. - Publisher.","['Shakespeare, william, 1564-1616, authorship']",,,,,['OL39634A'],3,for more than two hundred years after william shakespeares death no one doubted that he had written his plays since then however dozens of candidates have been proposed for the authorship of what is generally agreed to be the finest body of work by a writer in the english language in this remarkable book shakespeare scholar james shapiro explains when and why so many people began to question whether shakespeare wrote his plays among the doubters have been such writers and thinkers as sigmund freud henry james mark twain and helen keller it is a fascinating story replete with forgeries deception false claimants ciphers and codes conspiracy theories and a stunning failure to grasp the power of the imagination as contested will makes clear much more than proper attribution of shakespeares plays is at stake in this authorship controversy underlying the arguments over whether christopher marlowe francis bacon or the earl of oxford wrote shakespeares plays are fundamental questions about literary genius specifically about the relationship of life and art are the plays and poems of shakespeare a sort of hidden autobiography do hamlet macbeth and the other great plays somehow reveal who wrote them shapiro is the first shakespeare scholar to examine the authorship controversy and its history in this way explaining what it means why it matters and how it has persisted despite abundant evidence that william shakespeare of stratford wrote the plays attributed to him this is a brilliant historical investigation that will delight anyone interested in shakespeare and the literary imagination publisher,4

For Want of a Nail,"Most readers will not have the unwary reviewer's pleasure of discovering for themselves that this is a unique spoof. Very """"scholarly"""" written in perfect deadpan with elaborate footnotes, the book begins with a history of the American Revolution -- or rather failed rebellion -- after which a group under the leadership of Hamilton, Madison, Benedict Arnold, et al. emigrate to the Mexican territories and form the United States of Mexico with cotton slavery and a continental destiny. The Confederation of North America meanwhile proceeds to industrialize; there is the Rocky Mountain War between the two in the mid-19th century and a conflict with Russia over Yukon gold. Mexico, where the Anglos dominate the others, gets taken over by a vast Rockefellerish corporation; the U.S. -- that is, the """"C.N.A."""" -- pulls itself out of depression by producing military supplies for a war it never enters; guilt becomes intense and an anti-rational, anti-materialistic movement grows.

Dragon and Herdsman,"Jack Morgan has had it rough. He was orphaned at three, then lost his Uncle Virgil ten years later. But the plucky fourteen-year-old didn't know what rough was until he met Draycos, sole survivor of an advance force of alien refugees that had been brutally ambushed over the world where Jack was in hiding from the authorities. The K'da poet-warrior needed to bond with a host, or he would die; the reformed boy thief and con artist needed a friend, someone he could depend on as he tried to clear his name. Since then they've formed a unique team, determined to find and expose those responsible for the slaughter of Draycos's team. In the months since fate threw them together, they've been through a lot. But when Jack tries to hack the computer in an office of the notorious Malison Ring, their quest nearly ends in the jaws of that mercenary organization's trap. Luckily, Alison Kayna, a girl Jack had worked with as a reluctant mercenary for another outfit, comes to his rescue. Evading pursuit, they escape to the primitive world of Rho Scorvi, where she's planned a rendezvous with friends. But at the edge of Rho Scorvi's hundred-mile-wide forest, they make a shocking discovery: traveling with a group of the planet's native Erassvas is a small lost colony of Draycos's own race, the K'da. But unlike Draycos's people, these K'da--known as Phookas--are slow, lethargic, and unintelligent. When the Malison Ring tracks the Essenay to Rho Scorvi, Jack realizes that unless he and Draycos and a reluctant Alison can lead the Phookas to safety in the forest, these unfortunate creatures will become the latest victims of the genocide that threatens to wipe out their entire race. Jack has already been a thief, a soldier, and a slave. Now he must become a herdsman, protecting the Phookas from danger as they travel deep into the unexplored forest. But even more importantly, he must protect from the mercenaries and Alison the dark secret of the herd and Jack's poet-warrior ally. Only if they succeed do they stand a chance of surviving Rho Scorvi to continue their quest . . .","['Adventure and adventurers', 'Fiction', 'Dragons', 'Mercenary troops', 'Soldiers', 'Orphans', 'Science fiction', 'Mercenary soldiers', 'Adventure fiction', 'Adventure stories', 'Dragons, fiction', ""Children's fiction"", 'Adventure and adventurers, fiction', 'Soldiers, fiction', 'Orphans, fiction']",,,,,['OL3315835A'],13,jack morgan has had it rough he was orphaned at three then lost his uncle virgil ten years later but the plucky fourteenyearold didnt know what rough was until he met draycos sole survivor of an advance force of alien refugees that had been brutally ambushed over the world where jack was in hiding from the authorities the kda poetwarrior needed to bond with a host or he would die the reformed boy thief and con artist needed a friend someone he could depend on as he tried to clear his name since then theyve formed a unique team determined to find and expose those responsible for the slaughter of draycoss team in the months since fate threw them together theyve been through a lot but when jack tries to hack the computer in an office of the notorious malison ring their quest nearly ends in the jaws of that mercenary organizations trap luckily alison kayna a girl jack had worked with as a reluctant mercenary for another outfit comes to his rescue evading pursuit they escape to the primitive world of rho scorvi where shes planned a rendezvous with friends but at the edge of rho scorvis hundredmilewide forest they make a shocking discovery traveling with a group of the planets native erassvas is a small lost colony of draycoss own race the kda but unlike draycoss people these kdaknown as phookasare slow lethargic and unintelligent when the malison ring tracks the essenay to rho scorvi jack realizes that unless he and draycos and a reluctant alison can lead the phookas to safety in the forest these unfortunate creatures will become the latest victims of the genocide that threatens to wipe out their entire race jack has already been a thief a soldier and a slave now he must become a herdsman protecting the phookas from danger as they travel deep into the unexplored forest but even more importantly he must protect from the mercenaries and alison the dark secret of the herd and jacks poetwarrior ally only if they succeed do they stand a chance of surviving rho scorvi to continue their quest,3
An afternoon walk,"On a leisurely afternoon walk one summer day Ella and her five-year-old daughter come upon an abandoned house with an eerie overgrown garden. For the attractive young housewife and her imaginative child, the old house conjures up fantasies of grand parties and bygone fashions. But in the midst of the reverie they hear a horrible, throaty scream and, from a second-story window, see the spreading white wings of an owl taking flight.

At home that evening, Ella describes the experience to her husband, Max, only to be reminded that, having recently lost a child at birth, she is still emotionally unstable. Later, pointing out her strange lapses of memory, he insists that she needs more quiet and rest. Ella reluctantly agrees with him and all but forgets the experience, even though she feels it is somehow connected with the sudden disappearance of a woman in the neighborhood.

Then she begins receiving a series of anonymous phone calls. Trapped between the cold neglect of her husband, who openly questions her sanity, and the increasing terror of the calls, which hint that her child is in danger, Ella herself comes to question her own sanity...

Night Shift,"Stephen King has brought together nineteen of his most unsettling short pieces--bizarre tales of dark doing and unthinkable acts from the twilight regions where horror and madness take on eerie, unearthly forms...where noises in the walls and shadows by the bed are always signs of something dreadful on the prowl.

The settings are familiar and unsuspected--a high school, a factory, a truck stop, a laundry, a field of Nebraska corn. But in Stephen King's world any place can serve as devil's ground...if the time of night is propitious, and the forces of darkness are strong, and the victims are caught just slightly off their guard...

The Problem with Murmur Lee,"The bestselling author of Before Women Had Wings spins a wild new tale about the strong bonds among a group of friends that loses its quirkiest member, Murmur Lee. Exploring new literary territory while keeping to her native Floridian roots, Fowler is here at her most original and entertaining.As a new year dawns over the island of Iris Haven, Murmur Lee Harp and her lover, Billy, go for a romantic sail without a care in the world. The evening comes to an abrupt halt when Murmur Lee discovers that she has drowned--but by whose hand?--in the Iris Haven river.Grief-stricken and haunted by the mysteries surrounding her death, Murmur Lee's circle of friends sets out to discover what really happened to her, and in the process they learn as much about her failings and triumphs as their own. After years of self-exile in the North, Charlee Mudd returns to set her best friend's affairs in order, only to confront her own ghosts. Edith Piaf, a former marine whose sex change at the age of sixty-two Murmur Lee supported unquestioningly, must find the confidence to carry on without the encouragement of her friend. Lonely widower Dr. Zachary Klein plummets into the depths of depression at the loss of the second woman he has ever loved. As for Murmur Lee--who lived her entire life on an island named by her great-great grandfather in honor of the Greek goddess who receives the souls of dying women--in death she experiences her own journey as she is plunged into her familial past and discovers the truth about who she really is. With poignancy and humor Fowler weaves the voices of Murmur and her friends into a compelling narrative.

"Poems, Series 1","From the book:The verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson long since called ""the Poetry of the Portfolio,"" - something produced absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of expression of the writer's own mind. Such verse must inevitably forfeit whatever advantage lies in the discipline of public criticism and the enforced conformity to accepted ways. On the other hand, it may often gain something through the habit of freedom and the unconventional utterance of daring thoughts.

John Quincy Watson was a skilled young pilot flying B-29s over Japan when he was shot down and taken prisoner in 1945.

Fifty years later, now a prominent religious figure nearing retirement, Bishop Watson believes he has long since overcome the excruciating memories of his months as a POW.

Truman and Pendergast,"No portion of the political career of Harry S. Truman was more fraught with drama than his relationship with Thomas J. Pendergast. In one of their earliest meetings, the two men were momentarily at odds after Truman, who was then presiding judge of Jackson County, gave a $400,000 road contract to a construction company in South Dakota, and Pendergast, the boss of Kansas City, wasn't very happy about it. He had someone else in mind for the contract.

In 1934, after considering fourteen other men, Pendergast sponsored Truman for the Senate. Although Truman had often cooperated with Pendergast on patronage issues, he had never involved himself in the illegalities that would eventually destroy the Pendergast machine. When the Boss was sent to Leavenworth for tax evasion in 1939, Truman was astonished.

Because of the stigma of Truman's Pendergast connection, the 1940 Democratic primary was the tightest election in his entire political career. He won by fewer than eight thousand votes. In Truman and Pendergast, Robert H. Ferrell presents Truman's struggle to keep his Senate seat without the aid of Pendergast and despite Stark's enlistment of Roosevelt against him. Ferrell shows that Truman won the election in his typical fashion - going directly to the people, speaking honestly and like one of them.","['20th century', 'Friends and associates', 'Large type books', 'Politics and government']",['Kansas City (Mo.)'],"['Harry S.

Set against the backcloth of National Socialism, [this novel] is told in the first person by the central figure, Oskar Matzerath, tracing Oskar's history, beginning with his grandparents, and finishing at his thirtieth birthday (1954). Oskar is a dwarf, whose passion is his tin drum, which exercises some of the power of the Pied Piper's pipe, and he possesses a voice which is capable of breaking glass of all kinds at considerable range. The magic of Oskar's voice is matched by his ability to arrest his growth, but here, as elsewhere, the book moves on two planes, for the adult burgher world believes that his failure to develop is due to a fall. The grotesque figure of Oskar is accompanied by a grotesque series of happenings throughout his life, especially the eccentric deaths of those around him ... Oskar is finally condemned for a murder he has not committed and placed in a mental hospital. Oskar's detachment from the normal world enables him to comment upon it, and the book presents a dry and ironic review of the history of Oskar's times from the standpoint of Danzig, which was his home [as well as the author's].-The Oxford Companion to German Literature.","['Fiction', 'History', 'German Historical fiction', 'Dwarfs', 'German Political fiction', 'Political fiction', '1945-1955', 'Translations into English', 'German fiction', 'Historical fiction', 'German language materials', 'Duits', 'German poetry', 'Letterkunde', 'German literature', 'German drama', 'LITERATURE', 'NOVEL', 'Germany, fiction', 'Poland, fiction', 'Fiction, historical', 'People with disabilities, fiction', 'Fiction, historical, general', 'Novela política', 'Historia', 'Ficción', 'Novela histórica', 'Novela', 'Romans, nouvelles', 'Histoire', 'Enanos', 'Roman allemand', 'Kleinwüchsiger', 'Romance Alemao', 'Translations into Spanish', 'Novela histórica alemana', 'Traducciones al español', 'Germanic literature']","['Germany', 'Allemagne', 'Danzig', 'Region', 'Alemania']",,"['1945-1955', '1945-', '20th century', '20e siècle']",,['OL28731A'],24,die blechtrommel ist ein roman von günter grass er erschien 1959 als auftakt der danziger trilogie und gehört zu den meistgelesenen romanen der deutschen nachkriegsliteratur der roman lässt sich als historischer roman zeitroman schelmenroman und entwicklungsroman charakterisieren set against the backcloth of national socialism this novel is told in the first person by the central figure oskar matzerath tracing oskars history beginning with his grandparents and finishing at his thirtieth birthday 1954 oskar is a dwarf whose passion is his tin drum which exercises some of the power of the pied pipers pipe and he possesses a voice which is capable of breaking glass of all kinds at considerable range the magic of oskars voice is matched by his ability to arrest his growth but here as elsewhere the book moves on two planes for the adult burgher world believes that his failure to develop is due to a fall the grotesque figure of oskar is accompanied by a grotesque series of happenings throughout his life especially the eccentric deaths of those around him oskar is finally condemned for a murder he has not committed and placed in a mental hospital oskars detachment from the normal world enables him to comment upon it and the book presents a dry and ironic review of the history of oskars times from the standpoint of danzig which was his home as well as the authorsthe oxford companion to german literature,3

The Last Avant-Garde,"A landmark work of cultural history--now in paperback--by one of our best critics and chroniclers: the story of how four young poets reinvented literature and turned New York into the art capital of the world. 

Greenwich Village, New York, circa 1951. Every night, at a rundown tavern with a magnificent bar called the Cedar Tavern, an extraordinary group or painters, writers, poets, and hangers-on arrive to drink, argue, tell jokes, fight, start affairs, and bang out a powerful new aesthetic. Their style is playful, irreverent, tradition-shattering, and brilliant. Out of these friendships, and these conversations, will come the works of art and poetry that will define New York City as the capital of world culture--abstract expressionism and the New York School of Poetry. 

A richly detailed portrait of one of the great movements in American arts and letters, *The Last Avant-Garde* covers the years 1948-1966 and focuses on four fast friends -- the poets Frank O'Hara, James Schuyler, John Ashbery, and Kenneth Koch. Lehman brings to vivid life the extraordinary creative ferment of the time and place, the relationship of great friendship to art, and the powerful influence that a group of visual artisits--especially Jane Freilicher, Larry Rivers, and Fairfield Porter--had on the literary efforts of the New York School.

Life in the valley of death,"""Dubbed the ""Indiana Jones"" of wildlife science by The New York Times, Alan Rabinowitz has devoted - and risked - his life to protect nature's great endangered animals. He has journeyed to the remote corners of the earth in search of wild things, surviving treacherous terrain, plane crashes, and hostile governments. Life in the Valley of Death recounts his most ambitious and dangerous adventure yet: the creation of the world's largest tiger preserve deep in the forests of Asia."" ""The tale is set in the lush Hukawng Valley of Myanmar (formerly Burma), home to perhaps one of the largest tiger populations outside of India - a population threatened by rampant poaching and gold prospectors. To save the remaining tigers, Rabinowitz must navigate not only an unforgiving landscape, but the tangled web of politics in Myanmar. Confronted with a military dictatorship, an insurgent army, tribes once infamous for taking the heads of their enemies, and villagers living on less than one U.S. dollar per day, the scientist and adventurer is thrust into a diplomatic minefield."" ""Much more than a wildlife adventure, Life in the Valley of Death is also a personal story of perseverance. Rabinowitz shares his painful struggle to overcome a severe stutter, and how the isolation he felt as a child inspired his love of big cats. Then as an adult working to save Myanmar's tigers, Rabinowitz is diagnosed with incurable cancer. Forced to face the fragility of his own existence, he comes to realize the parallels between the human condition and the fight for wildlife - both requiring constant attention and adaptation.""--book jacket.","['Conservation', 'Tigers', 'Tiger', 'Wildlife conservation, asia']","['Burma', 'Hukawng Valley']",['Alan Rabinowitz (1953-)'],,,['OL39424A'],6,dubbed the indiana jones of wildlife science by the new york times alan rabinowitz has devoted and risked his life to protect natures great endangered animals he has journeyed to the remote corners of the earth in search of wild things surviving treacherous terrain plane crashes and hostile governments life in the valley of death recounts his most ambitious and dangerous adventure yet the creation of the worlds largest tiger preserve deep in the forests of asia the tale is set in the lush hukawng valley of myanmar formerly burma home to perhaps one of the largest tiger populations outside of india a population threatened by rampant poaching and gold prospectors to save the remaining tigers rabinowitz must navigate not only an unforgiving landscape but the tangled web of politics in myanmar confronted with a military dictatorship an insurgent army tribes once infamous for taking the heads of their enemies and villagers living on less than one us dollar per day the scientist and adventurer is thrust into a diplomatic minefield much more than a wildlife adventure life in the valley of death is also a personal story of perseverance rabinowitz shares his painful struggle to overcome a severe stutter and how the isolation he felt as a child inspired his love of big cats then as an adult working to save myanmars tigers rabinowitz is diagnosed with incurable cancer forced to face the fragility of his own existence he comes to realize the parallels between the human condition and the fight for wildlife both requiring constant attention and adaptationbook jacket,7

His techniques, signature and other matters are fully explained by the editors in the Introduction, while in the Catalogue itself every genuine Dali is illustrated along with precise details concerning the number of prints issued in every edition, the date of publication, papers and watermarks, the dimensions of images, the printers and publishers - all the crucial information necessary to distinguish the real Dali from unauthorized editions and outright forgeries.

Midsummer century,"This strange science fiction novel is not very well known but it is still one of the most interesting and mind boggling science fiction novels that I have ever read. It mixes the paranormal with science fiction and stretches the limits of ones imagination without becoming implausible or scientifically unacceptable. I first read this novel in Swedish when I was young and more recently in English. The Swedish title was ""The World of the Birds"" or ""The Planet of the Birds"".

An accident propels the mind of the young astrophysicist John Martels to the 250th century (23,000 years into the future), or the midsummer century. It should be noted, that according to this novel the mind is a complex self aware electromagnetic field. His mind emerges in the brain-case of a future being with a very powerful mind, the so called Qvant.

Human civilization has fallen and risen again many times and both humans and birds have evolved. In the 250th century the birds have evolved into telepathic and intelligent beings who seek to exterminate their main rivals; the humans. Humans (or the human descendents) of the 250th century have great paranormal powers but are death oriented, and have not used their intelligence to develop an advanced civilization; in fact they are not even interested in organized resistance against the birds. John Martel is thrust into a fight for the continued existence of his own mind as well as a fight for the continued existence of the human race of the future, and that is without being able to use his own physical body. In an odd way this novel also succeeded to fuse the reincarnation of the human mind with the rebirth of civilizations.",['American Science fiction'],,['Humans'],['The Future'],,['OL34434A'],9,this strange science fiction novel is not very well known but it is still one of the most interesting and mind boggling science fiction novels that i have ever read it mixes the paranormal with science fiction and stretches the limits of ones imagination without becoming implausible or scientifically unacceptable i first read this novel in swedish when i was young and more recently in english the swedish title was the world of the birds or the planet of the birds an accident propels the mind of the young astrophysicist john martels to the 250th century 23000 years into the future or the midsummer century it should be noted that according to this novel the mind is a complex self aware electromagnetic field his mind emerges in the braincase of a future being with a very powerful mind the so called qvant human civilization has fallen and risen again many times and both humans and birds have evolved in the 250th century the birds have evolved into telepathic and intelligent beings who seek to exterminate their main rivals the humans humans or the human descendents of the 250th century have great paranormal powers but are death oriented and have not used their intelligence to develop an advanced civilization in fact they are not even interested in organized resistance against the birds john martel is thrust into a fight for the continued existence of his own mind as well as a fight for the continued existence of the human race of the future and that is without being able to use his own physical body in an odd way this novel also succeeded to fuse the reincarnation of the human mind with the rebirth of civilizations,18

"Summer on the lakes, in 1843","Sarah Margaret Fuller Ossoli (1810-1850), better known as Margaret Fuller, was a writer, editor, translator, early feminist thinker, critic, and social reformer who was associated with the Transcendentalist movement in New England. This is her introspective account of a trip to the Great Lakes region in 1843. Organized as a series of travel episodes interspersed with literary and social commentary, the work displays a style common to the portfolios, sketch books, and commonplace books kept by educated nineteenth-century women. In addition to her own thoughts about natural landscapes and human encounters, Fuller includes stories, legends, allegorical dialogues, poems, and excerpts from the works of other authors. When she traveled to the Midwest, Fuller was exhausted by her work as editor of the Dial, the Transcendentalist journal she edited with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Accompanied during part of the journey by her friends James Clarke and Sarah Clarke, who created the book’s etchings, Fuller traveled by train, steamboat, carriage, and on foot in a circle from Niagara Falls north to Mackinac Island and Sault Ste. Marie, west to Milwaukee, south to Pawpaw, Illinois, and back to Buffalo. Fuller discusses Chicago in some detail, and laments the unjust treatment of Native Americans. She comments on the difficulties of pioneer life for women and on the degradation of the region’s beautiful and exhilarating natural environment. She speaks favorably about the British-American agrarian visionary, Morris Birbeck, and includes a short story about an old school friend, Mariana, who dies because her active mind cannot adapt to the restrictive codes of behavior prescribed for the era’s elite women.

"On kissing, tickling and being bored","Tickle a child, and she peals with laughter. Go on too long, and her laughter is sure to turn to tears. Where is that ticklish line between pleasure and pain? Why do we risk its being crossed? Does psychoanalysis possess the language to talk about such an extraordinary ordinary thing? In a style that is writerly and audacious, Adam Phillips takes up this subject and others largely overlooked by psychoanalysis - kissing, worrying, risk, solitude, and composure.

He writes about phobias as a kind of theory, a form of protection against curiosity; about analysis as a patient's way of reconstituting solitude; about ""good-enough"" mothering as the antithesis of ""bad-enough"" imperialism; about psychoanalysis as an attempt to cure idolatry through idolatry; and even about farting as it relates to worrying.

Psychoanalysis began as a virtuoso improvisation within the science of medicine, but virtuosity has given way to the dream of science that only the examined life is worth living. Phillips shows that the drive to omniscience has been unfortunate both for psychoanalysis and for life.

On Kissing, Tickling, and Being Bored is a set of meditations on underinvestigated themes in psyochoanalysis that shows how much one's psychic health depends on establishing a realm of life that successfully resists examination.","['Psychoanalysis', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Psychoanalytic Theory', 'Collected Works']",,"['D.

Essays,"""Bacon's Essays have attracted an eager readership since their publication in 1625. They sum up a lifetime's observations on the whole range of human activity, by one of the keenest minds of the Renaissance.

'Anne Perry can write a Victorian mystery that would make Dickens' eyes pop' - New York Times Book Review

He is not going to die, after all, in this Victorian pesthouse called a hospital. But the accident that felled him on a London street has left him with only half a life, because his memory and his entire past have vanished. His name, they tell him, is William Monk, and he is a London police detective; the mirror reflects a face that women would like, but he senses he has been more feared than loved.

Monk is given a particularly sensational case: the brutal murder of Major the Honourable Joscelin Grey, Crimean war hero and a popular man about town, in his rooms in fashionable Mecklenburgh Square. It's an assignment to make or break an investigator, for the exalted status of the victim puts any representative of the police in the precarious position of having to pry into a noble family's secrets.

Suggesting that his superior, the wily Runcorn, hopes he will fail, Monk returns to a world where he cannot distinguish friend from foe.

"The Jewish chronicle and Anglo-Jewry, 1841-1991","Founded in 1841, the Jewish Chronicle is the oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in the world. A force for change, a forum for debate and a shaper of Jewish identity; it has played a central part in the development of modern Anglo-Jewry; More than just a mirror of Anglo-Jewish life, registering waves of immigration and social change, the JC has been an active player in historical events. Its editors have intervened decisively in communal history and debated with British statesmen.

Once a fierce opponent of Zionism, the paper became its strongest champion. At the time of the Balfour Declaration, Jewish, British and world history intersected in its pages. So important was its influence that in 1947 the directors sacked the editor because they feared his belligerent articles on Palestine would cause anti-Semitism. No historian can understand the inner life of British Jews without looking at the social reports, the sports column, arts and cultural coverage and the advertising that the paper has carried.

"Memory and gender in medieval Europe, 900-1200","Remembering the past in the Middle Ages is a subject that is usually perceived as a study of chronicles and annals written by monks in monasteries. Following in the footsteps of early Christian historians such as Eusebius and St. Augustine, the medieval chroniclers are thought of as men isolated in their monastic institutions, writing about the world around them.

Elisabeth van Houts forcefully challenges this view, and emphasizes the collaboration between men and women in the memorial tradition of the Middle Ages through both narrative sources (chronicles, saints' lives and miracles) and material culture (objects such as jewellery, memorial stones and sacred vessels).

Men may have dominated the pages of literature from the period, but they would not have had half the stories to write about if women had not told them: thus the remembrance of the past was a human experience shared equally between men and women.","['Historiography', 'History', 'Medieval Civilization', 'Medieval Literature', 'Memory', 'Middle Ages', 'Oral tradition', 'Sources', 'Women', 'Civilization, medieval', 'Gender identity', 'Sex role']",['Europe'],,"['476-1492', 'Middle Ages, 500-1500']",,['OL21334A'],6,remembering the past in the middle ages is a subject that is usually perceived as a study of chronicles and annals written by monks in monasteries following in the footsteps of early christian historians such as eusebius and st augustine the medieval chroniclers are thought of as men isolated in their monastic institutions writing about the world around them elisabeth van houts forcefully challenges this view and emphasizes the collaboration between men and women in the memorial tradition of the middle ages through both narrative sources chronicles saints lives and miracles and material culture objects such as jewellery memorial stones and sacred vessels men may have dominated the pages of literature from the period but they would not have had half the stories to write about if women had not told them thus the remembrance of the past was a human experience shared equally between men and women,4

Crisis on Doona,"RETURN TO DOONA ...

More than twenty-five years ago, the first Humans had set foot on Doona and had found a beautiful, unspoiled planet ... but they had also found that they were not alone there.

Their early survey had completely ignored or missed the fact that the planet was already settled by the alien feline-like Hrrubans. The ensuing conflict led to the historic Decision at Doona—a social experiment in coexistence between two races, one that had succeeded for a quarter of a century.

Now, that contract between the Humans and the Hrrubans has run out and is up for renewal. Everything that the partners have worked for—the peaceful future of their dreams, the delicate cross-species alliance itself—is at peril and at stake, and could ultimately be lost forever.

Multivalent functions,"Multivalent and in particular univalent functions play an important role in complex analysis. Great interest was aroused when de Branges in 1985 settled the long-standing Bieberbach conjecture for the coefficients of univalent functions. The second edition of Professor Hayman's celebrated book is the first to include a full and self-contained proof of this result, with a new chapter devoted to it. Another new chapter deals with coefficient differences of mean p-valent functions.

The book has been updated in several other ways, with recent theorems of Baernstein and Pommerenke on univalent functions of restricted growth and Eke's regularity theorems for the behaviour of the modulus and coefficients of mean p-valent functions. Some of the original proofs have been simplified.

The verses to his friends are bitchy, funny, and affectionate; those to his enemies are often wonderfully nasty.

Captain Phillip Keegan, Fox River’s chief of detectives, feels, despite the FBI and CIA, that this crime belongs to him.

Little by little, he and Father Dowling uncover a nest of sinister complications: small arms being sold to the Arabs; the panicked effort of an ex-member of an American terrorist group to change her identity; far-flung amorous conquests of Aaron Lieb as well as his lobbying activities. After the drowned body of the arms manufacturer’s son is found, the plot whirls until the wicked are satisfactorily brought to brook. </p>

Benedict, on one last adventure to Egypt, succumbs to fever abroad, and his son, George, is left to manage Morland Place.

A Pound of Paper,"In the rural Australia of the fifties where John Baxter grew up, reading books was disregarded with suspicion, owning and collecting them with utter incomprehension. Despite this, by the age of eleven Baxter had 'collected' his first book - The Poems of Rupert Brooke. He'd read the volume often, but now he had to own it. This was the beginning of what would become a major collection and a lifelong obsession.

His book-hunting would take him all over the world, but his first real find was in London in 1978, when he spotted a rare copy of a Graham Greene children's book while browsing on a stall in Swiss Cottage. It was going for 5 pence. This would also, fortuitously, be the day when he first encountered one of the legends of the book-selling world: Martin Stone. At various times pothead, international fugitive from justice, and professional rock musician, he would become John's mentor and friend.

In this brilliantly readable and funny book, John Baxter brings us into contact with such literary greats as Graham Greene, Kingsley Amis, J.G. Ballard and Ray Bradbury. But he also shows us how he penetrated the secret fraternity of 'runners' or book scouts - sleuths who use bluff and guile to hunt down their quarry - and joined them in scouring junk shops, markets, auction rooms and private homes for rarities.

Theory and philosophy of art,"This fourth volume of Professor Meyer Schapiro's Selected Papers contains his most important writings - some well-known and others previously unpublished - on the theory and philosophy of art.

Schapiro's highly lucid arguments, graceful prose, and extraordinary erudition guide readers through a rich variety of fields and issues: the roles in society of the artist and art, of the critic and criticism; the relationships between patron and artist, psychoanalysis and art, and philosophy and art.

Adapting critical methods from such wide-ranging fields as anthropology, linguistics, philosophy, biology, and other sciences, Schapiro appraises fundamental semantic terms such as ""organic style,"" ""pictorial style"", ""field and vehicle,"" and ""form and content""; he elucidates eclipsed intent in a well-known text by Freud on Leonardo da Vinci, in another by Heidegger on Vincent van Gogh.

He reflects on the critical methodology of Bernard Berenson, and on the social philosophy of art in the writings of both Diderot and the nineteenth century French artist/historian Eugene Fromentin. Throughout all of his writings, Meyer Schapiro provides us with a means of ordering our past that is reasoned and passionate, methodical and inventive.

Stanley Kubrick,"For decades, the films of Stanley Kubrick have staked out a claim at the core of our cultural landscape. In the 1950s, he was one of the few American film makers to achieve the gravitas of European cinema with Paths of Glory. To 1960s audiences, he was the man who made both Dr. Strangelove, the influential anti-war movie, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, the counterculture favorite.

In the 1970s he created his hymn to urban violence, A Clockwork Orange, and in the 1980s he distilled the nature of private madness and collective insanity with The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. His first film of the 1990s will be Eyes Wide Shut starring Tom Cruise.

Yet little is known of the man and the influence exerted by his private life on his public art. Born in the Bronx, Kubrick has lived since 1961 in seclusion in rural England. From in-depth interviews with a range of people who have known the man best, spanning from his childhood to the present, John Baxter now presents the most complete account available of Kubrick's life.

Strong Imagination,"Madness is the central mystery of the human psyche. Our minds evolved to give us a faithful understanding of reality, to allow us to integrate into our communities, and to help us adapt our behaviour to our environment. Yet in serious mental illness, the mind does exactly the opposite of these things. The sufferer builds castles of imaginative delusion, fails to adapt, and becomes a stranger among his own people. Yet mental illness is no marginal phenomenon: it is found in all societies and all historical epochs, and the genes that underlie it are quite common. Furthermore, the traits that identify the madman are found in attenuated form in normal thinking and feeling. The persistence of madness, then, is a terrible puzzle from both an evolutionary and a human point of view. In Strong Imagination, Daniel Nettle explores the nature of mental illness, the biological mechanisms that underlie it, and its link to creative genius. He goes on to consider the place of both madness and creative imagination in the evolution of our species. - Jacket flap.","['Creation (Literary, artistic, etc.)', 'Insanity', 'Art and mental illness', 'Genius and mental illness', 'Mental illness', 'Creation (literary, artistic, etc.)']",,,,,['OL21374A'],5,madness is the central mystery of the human psyche our minds evolved to give us a faithful understanding of reality to allow us to integrate into our communities and to help us adapt our behaviour to our environment yet in serious mental illness the mind does exactly the opposite of these things the sufferer builds castles of imaginative delusion fails to adapt and becomes a stranger among his own people yet mental illness is no marginal phenomenon it is found in all societies and all historical epochs and the genes that underlie it are quite common furthermore the traits that identify the madman are found in attenuated form in normal thinking and feeling the persistence of madness then is a terrible puzzle from both an evolutionary and a human point of view in strong imagination daniel nettle explores the nature of mental illness the biological mechanisms that underlie it and its link to creative genius he goes on to consider the place of both madness and creative imagination in the evolution of our species jacket flap,4

J. Parrish, author of Dead of Winter and Island of BonesNancy J. Cohen's Bad Hair Day mysteries shimmer with style and humor in the glow of the Florida sun. In her sixth hair-curling adventure, stylist Marla Shore lands in the midst of a murder with shadowed motives and the very darkest of roots...There's no love lost between Marla and Carolyn Sutton. Carolyn has never forgiven Marla for leaving Hairstyle Heaven to open her own place, especially since Marla's clientele grew as Carolyn's faded away. Carolyn retaliated by relocating near Marla, but couldn't put the highlights back in the balance sheet. Still, it's a nasty shock when Marla enters the meter room behind the shopping center that houses both salons and tumbles over her rival's body. Carolyn's neck is broken and a hank of her hair is missing.Marla's powerful curiosity would have been enough to send her snooping for clues, but when Detective Dalton Vail, her very significant other, actually asks her for help, nothing can hold her back. Her quest becomes even more personal when Wilda Cleaver, Carolyn's trusted psychic and new owner of her salon, insists that Carolyn's spirit is begging Marla to solve her murder. Adding a dose of blackmail, Wilda warns that someone Marla loves is in great danger but won't give details until Marla cracks the case. Marla's got her work cut out for her—poor Carolyn was far from popular...and maybe even farther from honest. There's Carolyn's snubbed sister, Linda, who only inherited an unspecified, ""valuable"" collection that appears to be missing, the chiropractor whose shady dealings Carolyn had uncovered, and the immigration lawyer who apparently had been issuing suspicious visas for Hairstyle Heaven's French-born staff.Add to all this some surprising news from Detective Vail and a blossoming romance for Marla's mother, and Marla's well-coiffed head is soon spinning. It will take all her skill to untangle the snarl of suspects, trim the list down to unmask the murderer—and learn what's behind Wilda's eerie premonitions before someone Marla loves is next.","['Beauty operators', 'Fiction', 'Marla Shore (Fictitious character)', 'Mystery', 'Women detectives', 'American Detective and mystery stories', 'Large type books', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, women sleuths', 'Shore, marla (fictitious character), fiction', 'Fiction, romance, general', 'Jewish women']",['Florida'],,,,['OL35283A'],11,bad hair day mystery 6intrepid marla shore is up to her elbows in hot water when a rival salon owner turns up deadnancy cohen has penned another follicleraising frolic with a wry twist of romancep j parrish author of dead of winter and island of bonesnancy j cohens bad hair day mysteries shimmer with style and humor in the glow of the florida sun in her sixth haircurling adventure stylist marla shore lands in the midst of a murder with shadowed motives and the very darkest of rootstheres no love lost between marla and carolyn sutton carolyn has never forgiven marla for leaving hairstyle heaven to open her own place especially since marlas clientele grew as carolyns faded away carolyn retaliated by relocating near marla but couldnt put the highlights back in the balance sheet still its a nasty shock when marla enters the meter room behind the shopping center that houses both salons and tumbles over her rivals body carolyns neck is broken and a hank of her hair is missingmarlas powerful curiosity would have been enough to send her snooping for clues but when detective dalton vail her very significant other actually asks her for help nothing can hold her back her quest becomes even more personal when wilda cleaver carolyns trusted psychic and new owner of her salon insists that carolyns spirit is begging marla to solve her murder adding a dose of blackmail wilda warns that someone marla loves is in great danger but wont give details until marla cracks the case marlas got her work cut out for herpoor carolyn was far from popularand maybe even farther from honest theres carolyns snubbed sister linda who only inherited an unspecified valuable collection that appears to be missing the chiropractor whose shady dealings carolyn had uncovered and the immigration lawyer who apparently had been issuing suspicious visas for hairstyle heavens frenchborn staffadd to all this some surprising news from detective vail and a blossoming romance for marlas mother and marlas wellcoiffed head is soon spinning it will take all her skill to untangle the snarl of suspects trim the list down to unmask the murdererand learn whats behind wildas eerie premonitions before someone marla loves is next,6

Introduction to differentiable manifolds,"""This book contains essential material that every graduate student must know. Written with Serge Lang's inimitable wit and clarity, the volume introduces the reader to manifolds, differential forms, Darboux's theorem, Frobenius, and all the central features of the foundations of differential geometry. Lang lays the basis for further study in geometric analysis, and provides a solid resource in the techniques of differential topology. The book will have a key position on my shelf. Steven Krantz, Washington University in St. Louis ""This is an elementary, finite dimensional version of the author's classic monograph, Introduction to Differentiable Manifolds (1962), which served as the standard reference for infinite dimensional manifolds. It provides a firm foundation for a beginner's entry into geometry, topology, and global analysis. The exposition is unencumbered by unnecessary formalism, notational or otherwise, which is a pitfall few writers of introductory texts of the subject manage to avoid. The author's hallmark characteristics of directness, conciseness, and structural clarity are everywhere in evidence. A nice touch is the inclusion of more advanced topics at the end of the book, including the computation of the top cohomology group of a manifold, a generalized divergence theorem of Gauss, and an elementary residue theorem of several complex variables. If getting to the main point of an argument or having the key ideas of a subject laid bare is important to you, then you would find the reading of this book a satisfying experience.""

For over two millennia in the West, familiarity with the literature, art, philosophy, and values of the Classical World has been synonymous with education itself. The traditions of the Greeks explain why Western Culture is so uniquely dynamic and why its tenets of democracy, capitalism, materialism, personal freedom, civil liberty, and constitutional government are now sweeping the globe.

The failure of today's Classicists has meant that formal study of the origins of Western Culture is disappearing from American life at precisely the time when it is most needed to explain, guide, and warn the public about both the wonders and dangers of their own culture.

Camber of Culdi,"Camber was the greatest of the Deryni -- that race of men who were gifted with arcane mental powers that set them above normal humans.  In later legends, he was to become a figure of mystery, known as both the patron saint of dark magic and the defender of humanity.  But now he sought only retirement on his family estates.

But it was not to be.

The kingdom of Gwynedd groaned under the tyranny of Imre and his sister and mistress, Ariella.  Normal humans were savagely persecuted by the king, whose Deryni ancestors had seized the throne from the rightful human Haldane line.  Camber could not even save his own son from the murderous treachery of Imre.

Three decades ago, a teenaged Lucas Cornith joined the Austrian Resistance, helping to lead escapees from German oppression across the Alps to Switzerland and safety. But when Hitler’s storm troopers got too close, Lucas fled his homeland, leaving his compatriots behind to face the Nazi’s wrath.
 
Many years later, Cornith is returning to his hometown for the first time since the war’s end. Now a world-renowned classical composer, he’s premiering a new musical work, The Horn of Roland, at a festival in Gries-am-See, the tiny Alpine village of his birth.

Now, as the wife of one of America's richest men, she arrives at Poinciana, the fabulous Palm Beach estate built by her mother-in-law, where she begins to sense hidden undercurrents of hospitality. From Jarrett Nichols, Ross's principal aide, to Ross's impetuous sister Gretchen-only a few years younger than Sharon herself-every resident of Poinciana greets her with suspicion and resentment. Even her dynamic, solicitous husband begins to seem like a dark and menacing stranger.

And then the incidents begin. Have the missing pieces of the priceless Logan art collection been mislaid or stolen? Did the rushing figure on the staircase whisper a warning or a threat? Who is behind the haunting that echoes down the elegant hallways, filling Sharon with remembered anguish and renewed pain?

The Wellsprings of Life,"This is the middle of a set of three biochemistry books Asimov wrote in the 1950’s and 1960’s which form a progressive examination of the field. The Wellsprings of Life is divided into four sections. 

The first is a general overview of life and its possible origins. Asimov spends a fair amount of time discussing the history of the struggles within biology and geology which lead to the modern world-view centered on Darwinian evolution, including a literal interpretation of the early chapters of Genesis, the issue of spontaneous generation, and the development of evolution by natural selection by Darwin and Wallace. Himself an ardent Darwinist, Asimov pulls no punches over his feelings regarding a literal reading of Genesis being used as the basis for thinking about the origin of life on earth, although he is sensitive to avoid dismissing the Bible’s religious value. The religious issues are, nonetheless, at the core of the first section, as generation after generation of scientist has to struggle against religious opposition to scientific progress, and Asimov tells this story well and with dramatic flair. (Some of his favorite stories about the history of science and the ideal ethics of the scientist are from this period of the history of biology: Darwin and Wallace, and the rediscovery of Mendel’s work.)

The second section is a general overview of the organization of life on the planet into phyla, subphyla, and so on, and a brief overview of cytology. The third then delves into the molecule and covers basic biochemistry, focusing on proteins, enzymes, and the DNA that makes them. The book ends with a chapter on the modern spontaneous generation and how science currently feels life on the Earth may have originated.

This is, in fact, an excellent volume which manages to cover a broad amount of material in a fairly short space. Each section is thorough, straightforward, and simple to understand, and the sections are interwoven well to create a coherent, logical whole. It is also a book which provides a good broad understanding of Asimov’s own philosophy regarding science, rationalism, religion, and ethics, and so is a good introduction to some of the author’s own approaches to life, as well.","['Science', 'Biology', 'Life (Biology)', 'Evolution', 'Evolution (Biology)']",,,,,['OL34221A'],12,this is the middle of a set of three biochemistry books asimov wrote in the 1950s and 1960s which form a progressive examination of the field the wellsprings of life is divided into four sections the first is a general overview of life and its possible origins asimov spends a fair amount of time discussing the history of the struggles within biology and geology which lead to the modern worldview centered on darwinian evolution including a literal interpretation of the early chapters of genesis the issue of spontaneous generation and the development of evolution by natural selection by darwin and wallace himself an ardent darwinist asimov pulls no punches over his feelings regarding a literal reading of genesis being used as the basis for thinking about the origin of life on earth although he is sensitive to avoid dismissing the bibles religious value the religious issues are nonetheless at the core of the first section as generation after generation of scientist has to struggle against religious opposition to scientific progress and asimov tells this story well and with dramatic flair some of his favorite stories about the history of science and the ideal ethics of the scientist are from this period of the history of biology darwin and wallace and the rediscovery of mendels work the second section is a general overview of the organization of life on the planet into phyla subphyla and so on and a brief overview of cytology the third then delves into the molecule and covers basic biochemistry focusing on proteins enzymes and the dna that makes them the book ends with a chapter on the modern spontaneous generation and how science currently feels life on the earth may have originated this is in fact an excellent volume which manages to cover a broad amount of material in a fairly short space each section is thorough straightforward and simple to understand and the sections are interwoven well to create a coherent logical whole it is also a book which provides a good broad understanding of asimovs own philosophy regarding science rationalism religion and ethics and so is a good introduction to some of the authors own approaches to life as well,4

This book of starres,"""This Book of Starres"" is one of those all-too-rare books in which an author's love of someone's work - in this case, the writings of seventeenth-century English poet George Herbert - leads him to guide the reader on a journey of exploration. James Boyd White takes the position that ""literature of this quality can be read by an ordinary intelligent reader, bringing whatever he or she happens to be to the process.

This is a claim for the accessibility, and also the importance, of the great works of our tradition, so often now insulated by a kind of professional barrier."".

Herbert's poetry presents a special set of challenges: it is to the modern ear archaic, difficult in thought and structure, and entirely theological in character. Yet no poet is more deeply admired by those who know him well. ""This Book of Starres"" engages its audience in a process of reading that shows this verse to be vivid and alive, speaking directly across the barriers of time and culture.

It is the record of one person's life-changing involvement with Herbert's poetry; in this it is about not only how, but why we read great poetry.","['English Christian poetry', 'History and criticism', 'Criticism and interpretation', 'Reader-response criticism', 'Herbert, george, 1593-1633']",,['George Herbert (1593-1633)'],"['Early modern, 1500-1700']",,['OL31056A'],9,this book of starres is one of those alltoorare books in which an authors love of someones work in this case the writings of seventeenthcentury english poet george herbert leads him to guide the reader on a journey of exploration james boyd white takes the position that literature of this quality can be read by an ordinary intelligent reader bringing whatever he or she happens to be to the process this is a claim for the accessibility and also the importance of the great works of our tradition so often now insulated by a kind of professional barrier herberts poetry presents a special set of challenges it is to the modern ear archaic difficult in thought and structure and entirely theological in character yet no poet is more deeply admired by those who know him well this book of starres engages its audience in a process of reading that shows this verse to be vivid and alive speaking directly across the barriers of time and culture it is the record of one persons lifechanging involvement with herberts poetry in this it is about not only how but why we read great poetry,4

For more than forty years, Price has kept a working journal of his writing life.

Whether Price is reflecting on the rhythm of his day-to-day writing process or ruminating about the central character in what would become, for instance, Kate Vaiden - should she be a woman; what would be her name; why would the story be told in the first person? - he envelops the reader in the task at hand, in the trade being practiced. Instead of personal memoir or a collection of literary fragments, Learning a Trade presents what Price has called the ""ongoing minutes"" of his effort to learn his craft.

Equally enlightening as an overview of a career of developing prominence or as a perspective on the building of individual literary works, this volume not only allows the reader to hear the author's internal dialogue on the hundreds of questions that must be turned and mulled during the planning and writing of a novel but, in an unplanned way, creates its own compelling narrative.","['Authorship', 'Notebooks, sketchbooks', 'Problems, exercises', 'Problems, exercises, etc', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Criticism']",,"['Reynolds Price (1933-)', 'Reynolds Price']",,,['OL21434A'],10,from reynolds price much acclaimed author of awardwinning novels plays poems stories and essays comes a work that is unique among contemporary writers of american literature for more than forty years price has kept a working journal of his writing life now published for the first time learning a trade provides a revealing window into this writers creative process and craftsmans sensibilities whether price is reflecting on the rhythm of his daytoday writing process or ruminating about the central character in what would become for instance kate vaiden should she be a woman what would be her name why would the story be told in the first person he envelops the reader in the task at hand in the trade being practiced instead of personal memoir or a collection of literary fragments learning a trade presents what price has called the ongoing minutes of his effort to learn his craft equally enlightening as an overview of a career of developing prominence or as a perspective on the building of individual literary works this volume not only allows the reader to hear the authors internal dialogue on the hundreds of questions that must be turned and mulled during the planning and writing of a novel but in an unplanned way creates its own compelling narrative,18

The Irish-born professor of folklore has good looks, a sweet charm, and a host of Old World superstitions - all of which dazzle beautiful graduate student Sara Morgan. Plunging headlong into a sudden love affair, Sara barely has time to notice the dark drama unfolding on the campus.

Suddenly Sara is receiving crank phone calls, warning her to stay away from Liam ... fearing her ex-boyfriend Chip's next angry outburst ... wondering why Liam's unmarried sister, Margaret, is so suffocatingly close to them ... and trying to escape the lecherous stares of her boss, Milton Cohn, the dean of students and the owner of a murderous-looking knife collection.

Πολιτικός,"The Statesman is Plato's neglected political work, but it is crucial for an understanding of the development of his political thinking. In some respects it continues themes from the Republic, particularly the importance of knowledge as entitlement to rule. But there are also changes: Plato has dropped the ambitious metaphysical synthesis of the Republic, changed his view of the moral psychology of the citizen, and revised his position on the role of law and institutions.

In its presentation of the statesman's expertise, the Statesman modifies, as well as defending in original ways, this central theme of the Republic. This new translation is based on the revised Oxford Text of Plato and makes accessible the dialogue to students of political thought in clear and contemporary language.

A Loss of Patients,"Phil Keegan and the Fox River, IL police department are bewildered by a series of unexplained deaths. Two attractive women, friends, are found dead, about a month apart: the first, in her bathtub with her wrists cut, the second, drowned in her car that had fallen into the river. The circumstances are ambiguous and could suggest suicide... Two more deaths follow—a man and a woman in their car, from carbon monoxide, and again there is a suspicion of suicide. But in no case is the explanation of suicide totally convincing.  </p>

Captain Keegan, Lieutenant Horvath, and Officer Lamb keep digging away. And, of course, Father Dowling soon becomes involved, not only as confidant of Phil but also in his own right, while fulfilling his priestly functions. To heighten our enjoyment, McInery resorts to the comparatively rare device: the reader knows who the murderer is. thus, we can watch the duel, good vs. evil, progress. To such a point, in fact, that this time Father Dowling--who, in his sensitivity, finally spots the murderer--barely escapes alive. </p>

The enemy,"Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier's son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army's brightest stars. But in every cop's life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.New Year's Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down.  The world is changing.  And in a North Carolina ""hot-sheets"" motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can't be controlled. Within hours the general's wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.Two Special Forces soldiers--the toughest of the tough--are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher--an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit--is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have.But Reacher won't quit. He's fighting a new kind of war. And he's taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn't know he had. With his French-born mother dying--and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret--Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed...about his family, his career, his loyalties--and himself. Because this soldier's son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death--and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.From the Hardcover edition.","['Military police in fiction', 'Conspiracies in fiction', 'Generals', 'Jack Reacher (Fictitious character)', 'France in fiction', 'Generals in fiction', 'Crimes against', 'Fiction', 'Military police', 'Americans', 'Americans in fiction', 'Detective and mystery stories', 'Thriller', 'Conspiracies', 'Serial murders', 'Snipers', 'Reacher, jack (fictitious character), fiction', 'Fiction, thrillers, general', 'Large type books', 'Murder', 'United States', 'United States.

Colonial American newspapers,"In this book, scholar and journalist David A. Copeland provides a comprehensive discussion of the character and content of the news that ran in British American newspapers from their beginning in 1690 to the end of the colonial era.

Copeland reveals that the first generation of American papers focused on more than European news and governmental decrees and actions; they provided a variety of news topics designed to meet the informational needs of society, including news of the sea, Native Americans, religion, slaves, and crime.

In addition, news provided citizens with a certain amount of diversion and amusement through sensationalism, literature, poetry, and sports and kept colonial citizens apprised of weather, obituaries, accidents, agriculture, and social news.

To discover the news content of colonial newspapers, Copeland uses seventy-nine different English-language newspapers printed during the colonial period. Approximately seventy-four hundred newspaper issues were read in their entirety to provide a body of information previously unavailable to those studying media and colonial American history.

Colonial American Newspapers fills an important gap in the study of the content of colonial prints and concludes that as newspapers evolved to meet the informational needs of society, they helped unify the colonies by focusing upon events of local and intercolonial importance.

Colonial newspapers' claim that they printed ""the freshest Advices Foreign and Domestic"" developed into a thirst for news in America, something that New-York Gazette printer James Parker realized that the people ""can't be without.""","['American newspapers', '18th century', 'History', 'American newspapers, history']",,,['18th century'],,['OL39617A'],9,in this book scholar and journalist david a copeland provides a comprehensive discussion of the character and content of the news that ran in british american newspapers from their beginning in 1690 to the end of the colonial era copeland reveals that the first generation of american papers focused on more than european news and governmental decrees and actions they provided a variety of news topics designed to meet the informational needs of society including news of the sea native americans religion slaves and crime in addition news provided citizens with a certain amount of diversion and amusement through sensationalism literature poetry and sports and kept colonial citizens apprised of weather obituaries accidents agriculture and social news to discover the news content of colonial newspapers copeland uses seventynine different englishlanguage newspapers printed during the colonial period approximately seventyfour hundred newspaper issues were read in their entirety to provide a body of information previously unavailable to those studying media and colonial american history colonial american newspapers fills an important gap in the study of the content of colonial prints and concludes that as newspapers evolved to meet the informational needs of society they helped unify the colonies by focusing upon events of local and intercolonial importance colonial newspapers claim that they printed the freshest advices foreign and domestic developed into a thirst for news in america something that newyork gazette printer james parker realized that the people cant be without,18

The Cross of Christ,"The work of a lifetime, from one of the world's most influential thinkers, about the heart of the Christian faith. ""I could never myself believe in God, if it were not for the cross. . . . In the real world of pain, how could one worship a God who was immune to it?"" With compelling honesty John Stott confronts this generation with the centrality of the cross in God's redemption of the world -- a world now haunted by the memories of Auschwitz, the pain of oppression and the specter of nuclear war. Can we see triumph in tragedy, victory in shame? Why should an object of Roman distaste and Jewish disgust be the emblem of our worship and the axiom of our faith? And what does it mean for us today? Now from one of the foremost preachers and Christian leaders of our day comes theology at its readable best, a contemporary restatement of the meaning of the cross. At the cross Stott finds the majesty and love of God disclosed, the sin and bondage of the world exposed. More than a study of the atonement, this book brings Scripture into living dialogue with Christian theology and the twentieth century. What emerges is a pattern for Christian life and worship, hope and mission. Destined to be a classic study of the center of our faith, Stott's work is the product of a uniquely gifted pastor, scholar and Christian statesman.

Introduction to metaphysics,"Why is there anything at all, instead of nothing? How are we to understand what it is to be?

Heidegger argues, in magisterial, flowing and esoteric language, that Western civilisation has gone wrong because it has systematically misunderstood this question.

Instead, he claims that we have tried to understand physical things themselves. We have confused appearance with reality: we have replaced understanding with reason, wonder with technology, and use with exploitation.

A Short History of Secularism,"""What does it mean to call Western society 'secular'? What is 'secularism'? And how should we understand the concept of 'secularism' in international relations, particularly the clash between radical Islam and the West? The Latin term from which the word 'secular' is derived - 'saeculum' - means 'generation' or 'age', and came to mean that which belongs to this life, to the here and now, in this world. It is widely used as a shorthand for the ideology which shapes contemporary society without reference to the divine.However, according to Graeme Smith, 'secularism' represents a great deal more. He offers a radical reappraisal of the notion of secularism and its history, beginning with the Greeks and proceeding to modernity and the contemporary period. The assumption that the West is becoming increasingly secular is often unquestioned. By contrast, Dr Smith discerns a different kind of society: one informed by a historical legacy which makes sense only when it is appreciated that it is religious. Secularism was born of Christianity. Daringly - and very originally - Smith argues that it is impossible to understand the idea of the secular without appreciating that, at root, it is Christian.

The Birds of America,"The Audubon Society Baby Elephant Folio differs in a number of ways -- besides its dimensions -- from earlier editions of The Birds of America and from John James Audubon's original, massive Double-Elephant Folio, the heaviest volume of which weighs 56 pounds. These plates are organized not in the order that Audubon produced them for his subscribers but phylogenetically; that is, in a modern scientific classification sequence that somewhat parallels the evolutionary history of a genetically related group of organisms -- from the most primitive living examples to the most recently evolved -- in this case going from loons to sparrows and buntings. The numbering of our plates follows the taxonomical sequence of orders, families, and species in the Check-List of North American Birds prepared by the American Ornithologists' Union, as adapted and up-dated by the American Birding Association.

Puccini,"""Descended from four generations of distinguished composers and organists, Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924) was driven by family tradition and an ambitious mother to pursue a career that brought him worldwide recognition as the greatest composer of Italian opera after Giuseppe Verdi.

But behind the brilliant creator of such lasting works as La Boheme, Tosca, Madama Butterfly, La Fanciulla del West, La Rondine, and Turandot, there was a person racked with indecision, self-doubt, bouts of depression, and private misfortunes."".

""In this work, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz brings to life both the man and his circle. Setting Puccini's story within the worlds of his beloved Tuscany and the cutthroat opera business, the author follows the composer from boyhood in his ancestral Lucca, to his struggling student years at the Milan Conservatory, to his early successes and failures, to the artistic triumphs that earned him international celebrity and considerable wealth.

Filled with colorful details and anecdotes drawn from extensive primary sources as well as interviews with descendents, family friends, and colleagues, the book chronicles Puccini's personal sorrows and scandals and recounts his stormy professional rivalries and associations in England, Europe, and the United States. Phillips-Matz also untangles the threads of the gifted artist's complex and contradictory character. She reveals a sophisticated composer who often drew upon exotic thematic material and an elegant cosmopolite who loved his several villas, expensive cars, boats, and fine clothes. Yet Puccini remained passionately wedded to the simple life of the Tuscan countryside of his youth.

Bitter lemons,"With the publication of Justine Lawrence Durrell became, almost overnight, one of the most talked about, widely acclaimed novelists of the decade. Now, in Bitter Lemons, his focus has shifted from the world of his imagination to life itself. Writing in the exquisite poetic prose that critics have hailed as unequalled in contemporary literature, he tells the perceptive, often humorous story of his experiences on the island of Cyprus -- first as a visitor, then as a householder and teacher and finally as Press Advisor to a government on the verge of revolution. Partly because of his ability to speak fluent Greek, but mainly because of his rare understanding of the people of Cyprus, Durrell found a ready welcome in the little village where he chose to settle. His portrayal of the warm, friendly people among whom he made his home is but one of this book's many delights. There are vivid pictures of the villages on their ways of life, the ancient edifices, the flowers, mountains and sea, the sunlight that gave the island its unique, peaceful quality. There are, too, hilarious descriptions of the problems of buying a house and teaching English in the local high school, where all the girls fell in love with Durrell and showered him with presents of roses, poems and even a special kind of meatball. Gradually, however, life on the sunny island was darkened by political turmoil which exploded into a revolution when Cypriots, crying for union with Greece, rose up against the British. Durrell movingly recounts the slow deterioration of the political situation and the part he tried to play in helping both sides to understand each other. Finally forced to admit defeat, he resigned from the post he had held for two years as Press Officer and left the island.","['Description and travel', 'Politics and government', 'Social life and customs', 'Travel', 'Cyprus', 'Cyprus, description and travel', 'Cyprus, social life and customs', 'Cyprus - Politics and government', 'Cyprus - Social life and customs', 'Manners and customs', 'Durrell, lawrence, 1912-1990', 'Cyprus, politics and government']",['Cyprus'],['Lawrence Durrell'],,,"['OL21250A', 'OL12508337A', 'OL12184439A', 'OL15331247A']",13,with the publication of justine lawrence durrell became almost overnight one of the most talked about widely acclaimed novelists of the decade now in bitter lemons his focus has shifted from the world of his imagination to life itself writing in the exquisite poetic prose that critics have hailed as unequalled in contemporary literature he tells the perceptive often humorous story of his experiences on the island of cyprus first as a visitor then as a householder and teacher and finally as press advisor to a government on the verge of revolution partly because of his ability to speak fluent greek but mainly because of his rare understanding of the people of cyprus durrell found a ready welcome in the little village where he chose to settle his portrayal of the warm friendly people among whom he made his home is but one of this books many delights there are vivid pictures of the villages on their ways of life the ancient edifices the flowers mountains and sea the sunlight that gave the island its unique peaceful quality there are too hilarious descriptions of the problems of buying a house and teaching english in the local high school where all the girls fell in love with durrell and showered him with presents of roses poems and even a special kind of meatball gradually however life on the sunny island was darkened by political turmoil which exploded into a revolution when cypriots crying for union with greece rose up against the british durrell movingly recounts the slow deterioration of the political situation and the part he tried to play in helping both sides to understand each other finally forced to admit defeat he resigned from the post he had held for two years as press officer and left the island,7

*Ordinary Men* is the true story of Reserve Police Battalion 101 of the German Order Police, which was responsible for mass shootings as well as round-ups of Jewish people for deportation to Nazi death camps in Poland in 1942. Browning argues that most of the men of RPB 101 were not fanatical Nazis but, rather, ordinary middle-aged, working-class men who committed these atrocities out of a mixture of motives, including the group dynamics of conformity, deference to authority, role adaptation, and the altering of moral norms to justify their actions. Very quickly three groups emerged within the battalion: a core of eager killers, a plurality who carried out their duties reliably but without initiative, and a small minority who evaded participation in the acts of killing without diminishing the murderous efficiency of the battalion whatsoever.

While this book discusses a specific Reserve Unit during WWII, the general argument Browning makes is that most people succumb to the pressures of a group setting and commit actions they would never do of their own volition.  

*Ordinary Men* is a powerful, chilling, and important work, with themes and arguments that continue to resonate today.","['Germany', 'Germany.

Parrot Blues,"""It"" is the sixth adventure in Judith Van Gieson's highly acclaimed suspense series featuring Albuquerque lawyer-cum-sleuth Neil Hamel. ""It"" is also the kidnapping of a remarkable woman, brilliant parrot researcher Deborah Dumaine, and a remarkable bird, an incomparably rare indigo macaw named Perigee.

When Dumaine's headstrong husband, Terrance Lewellen, plays a tape of the kidnapping for Neil and asks her to find his wife and bird, Neil is thrown headlong into a dark and dangerous realm where some will pay top dollar for smuggled parrots, and others will do anything - to the parrots, to anyone who crosses their path - that will learn them top dollar.

Though Neil suspects that Lewellen, who was in the throes of a bitter divorce from Dumaine, might somehow be involved in the kidnapping, she sets out in search of Wes Brown, the flaky, unscrupulous parrot smuggler whose voice Lewellen recognizes on the kidnap tape. Her search leads Neil and her Hispanic lover, the Kid, deep into the desert's vastness, to a big beached boat and a shadowy figure whose fanciful feathered mask and fully cocked pistol compete for Neil's attention.

She and the Kid elude this attacker, but they soon discover that one of Neil's prime suspects has been less fortunate: kidnapping has led to murder. As Neil sets out to find the killer, she encounters a cast of quirky, vividly realized Southwestern characters: the blustery Terrance; the cowardly Wes Brown; Deborah's wispy, weepy sister Sara from Santa Fe; Charlie Register, a good-ol'-boy banker with a hankering for Terrance's paintings; Rick Olney, Deborah's overeager lab assistant; and not least, the parrots, whose intricate, fascinating culture we humans are just beginning to fathom.

All the while Neil wonders what has become of Deborah Dumaine, whose absence seems as powerful as her presence. Even in this richly populated landscape, Neil stands out. Her wit, her compassion, and her keen appraisal of the unending battle between the natural world and humanity's unnatural impulses - all make her and this series among the best of their kind.","['Fiction', 'Neil Hamel (Fictitious character)', 'Women lawyers', 'Hamel, neil (fictitious character), fiction', 'New mexico, fiction', 'Women lawyers, fiction', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, women sleuths', 'Albuquerque (n.m.), fiction', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, general', 'Lawyers, fiction']",['Albuquerque (N.M.)'],,,,['OL31922A'],9,it is the sixth adventure in judith van giesons highly acclaimed suspense series featuring albuquerque lawyercumsleuth neil hamel it is also the kidnapping of a remarkable woman brilliant parrot researcher deborah dumaine and a remarkable bird an incomparably rare indigo macaw named perigee when dumaines headstrong husband terrance lewellen plays a tape of the kidnapping for neil and asks her to find his wife and bird neil is thrown headlong into a dark and dangerous realm where some will pay top dollar for smuggled parrots and others will do anything to the parrots to anyone who crosses their path that will learn them top dollar though neil suspects that lewellen who was in the throes of a bitter divorce from dumaine might somehow be involved in the kidnapping she sets out in search of wes brown the flaky unscrupulous parrot smuggler whose voice lewellen recognizes on the kidnap tape her search leads neil and her hispanic lover the kid deep into the deserts vastness to a big beached boat and a shadowy figure whose fanciful feathered mask and fully cocked pistol compete for neils attention she and the kid elude this attacker but they soon discover that one of neils prime suspects has been less fortunate kidnapping has led to murder as neil sets out to find the killer she encounters a cast of quirky vividly realized southwestern characters the blustery terrance the cowardly wes brown deborahs wispy weepy sister sara from santa fe charlie register a goodolboy banker with a hankering for terrances paintings rick olney deborahs overeager lab assistant and not least the parrots whose intricate fascinating culture we humans are just beginning to fathom all the while neil wonders what has become of deborah dumaine whose absence seems as powerful as her presence even in this richly populated landscape neil stands out her wit her compassion and her keen appraisal of the unending battle between the natural world and humanitys unnatural impulses all make her and this series among the best of their kind,6

The Chase,"For decades, Clive Cussler has been delighting readers with novels filled with suspense, action, and sheer audacity. Now he does it again, in one of the wildest, most entertaining historical thrillers in years.April 1950: The rusting hulk of a steam locomotive rises from the deep waters of a Montana lake. Inside is all that remains of three men who died forty-four years before. But it is not the engine or its grisly contents that interest the people watching nearby. It is what is about to come next . . . 
1906: For two years, the western states of America have been suffering an extraordinary crime spree: a string of bank robberies by a single man who cold-bloodedly murders any and all witnesses and then vanishes without a trace. Fed up by the depredations of the ""Butcher Bandit,"" the U.S. government brings in the best man they can find-a tall, lean, no-nonsense detective named Isaac Bell, who has caught thieves and killers coast to coast. But Bell has never had a challenge like this one. From Arizona to Colorado to the streets of San Francisco during its calamitous earthquake and fire, he pursues what is quickly becoming clear to him is the sharpest criminal mind he has ever encountered, and the woman who seems to hold the key to the bandit's identity. Using science, deduction, and intuition, Bell repeatedly draws near only to grasp at thin air, but at least he knows his pursuit is having an effect. Because his quarry is getting angry now, and has turned the chase back on him. The hunter has become the hunted. And soon it will take all of Isaac Bell's skills not merely to prevail . . . but to survive.

This is the story of 1970s America, a time when the most simple human decisions—what music you listen to, whether to speak to the kid in the seat next to you, whether to give up your lunch money—are laden with potential political, social and racial disaster. This is the story of 1990s America, when no one cared anymore.

This is the story of punk, that easy white rebellion, and crack, that monstrous plague. This is the story of the loneliness of the avant-garde artist and the exuberance of the graffiti artist.

This is the story of what would happen if two teenaged boys obsessed with comic book heroes actually had superpowers: They would screw up their lives.

This is the story of joyous afternoons of stickball and dreaded years of schoolyard extortion. This is the story of belonging to a society that doesn't accept you. This is the story of prison and of college, of Brooklyn and Berkeley, of soul and rap, of murder and redemption.

When two dead infants are dug up in the Callander Square gardens, the upper-class residents dismiss the burials as the desperate act of a low-born girl and resent the intrusion of Inspector Thomas Pitt into their well-ordered lives.

Leading a seemingly unstoppable horde of bestial, powerful minions and a host of insidious undead, Dagnarus captures mortal kingdom after mortal kingdom, until he stands before the very gates of New Vinnengael, as traitors within the city plot to yield the crown to the undead lord.In the darkness and turmoil that follows, all heroes must first master their own fears and weaknesses before they can take up the fight to stop Dagnarus, and the company spreads across many lands to face many perils. Mortally wounded by a Blood-knife wielded by an undead Vrykyl knight, the Baron Shadamehr lies dying, and even the many skills of his beautiful, beloved Alise may not be able to save him. Others face desperate journeys through hostile lands and difficult tests of character. And, unsuspected, a deadly Vrykyl stalks the pecwae Bashae -- and his precious burden, the human portion of the Sovereign Stone -- through the streets of New Vinnengael.Yet the gods have their own plans for this imperiled land, and drawn by an unknown call, the Dominion Lords head for the Portal of the Gods, the mystical, haunted site of Dagnarus's terrible treachery two hundred years beforehand. For if all the parts of the sundered Sovereign Stone can be reunited, the Dominion Lords can stop Dagnarus's unholy plans for domination. But one piece is still missing. . . .As the past and present converge in a desperate race to determine the future, an unlikely hero will arise. A man who will become far more than he ever dreamed possible and who holds the fate of all Loerem in his hands. And to save Loerem he must venture into a realm of utter terror and darkness . . . into the very blackness of the Void itself.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Magic', 'Heroes', 'Imaginary wars and battles', 'Good and evil', 'Fiction, fantasy, general']",,,,,"['OL19887A', 'OL448253A']",8,the dark lord dagnarus is back to destroy all mortals and only one thing can stop him the reunited sovereign stone but one piece is still missing the fate of loerem rests in the hands of an unlikely hero who must venture into the very blackness of the void itselffrom acclaimed new york times bestselling fantasists margaret weis and tracy hickman comes the spellbinding conclusion to the epic adventure of wonder courage magic and ambition that is the breathtaking world of the sovereign stoneover two hundred years have passed since the mystical sovereign stone was shattered and the world of loerem faced its most dangerous test ever the rise of the dark lord dagnarus but now dagnarus has stirred from the void and seeks the utter conquest of all loerem leading a seemingly unstoppable horde of bestial powerful minions and a host of insidious undead dagnarus captures mortal kingdom after mortal kingdom until he stands before the very gates of new vinnengael as traitors within the city plot to yield the crown to the undead lordin the darkness and turmoil that follows all heroes must first master their own fears and weaknesses before they can take up the fight to stop dagnarus and the company spreads across many lands to face many perils mortally wounded by a bloodknife wielded by an undead vrykyl knight the baron shadamehr lies dying and even the many skills of his beautiful beloved alise may not be able to save him others face desperate journeys through hostile lands and difficult tests of character and unsuspected a deadly vrykyl stalks the pecwae bashae and his precious burden the human portion of the sovereign stone through the streets of new vinnengaelyet the gods have their own plans for this imperiled land and drawn by an unknown call the dominion lords head for the portal of the gods the mystical haunted site of dagnaruss terrible treachery two hundred years beforehand for if all the parts of the sundered sovereign stone can be reunited the dominion lords can stop dagnaruss unholy plans for domination but one piece is still missing as the past and present converge in a desperate race to determine the future an unlikely hero will arise a man who will become far more than he ever dreamed possible and who holds the fate of all loerem in his hands and to save loerem he must venture into a realm of utter terror and darkness into the very blackness of the void itself,3

From morality to virtue,"In this book, Slote offers the first full-scale foundational account of virtue ethics to have appeared in this century. In a plain and direct fashion, Slote advocates a particular form of such ethics for its intuitive and structural advantages over Kantianism, utilitarianism, and common-sense morality. He argues that the problems of these other views can be avoided and a plausible, contemporary version of virtue ethics achieved only by abandoning specifically moral concepts for general aretaic notions like admirability and virtue. Although this study is not bound by particular Aristotelian doctrines, From Morality to Virtue places an Aristotelian emphasis on both self-benefiting and other-benefiting virtues. Slote criticizes Kantian and common-sense morality for internal incoherencies and for downgrading the moral individual's well-being in some previously unnoticed ways. By contrast, this book defends a distinctive, intuitive, and symmetric ethical principle according to which we should balance self-concern with concern for others, but it also concludes that there is, contrary to utilitarianism, no single basis for status as a virtue nor any simple relation between the virtues and human well-being.","['Ethics', 'Common sense', 'Utilitarianism', 'Virtue.\x1e 0', 'Virtue', 'Kant, immanuel, 1724-1804', 'Virtue and virtues']",,['Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)'],,,['OL39366A'],5,in this book slote offers the first fullscale foundational account of virtue ethics to have appeared in this century in a plain and direct fashion slote advocates a particular form of such ethics for its intuitive and structural advantages over kantianism utilitarianism and commonsense morality he argues that the problems of these other views can be avoided and a plausible contemporary version of virtue ethics achieved only by abandoning specifically moral concepts for general aretaic notions like admirability and virtue although this study is not bound by particular aristotelian doctrines from morality to virtue places an aristotelian emphasis on both selfbenefiting and otherbenefiting virtues slote criticizes kantian and commonsense morality for internal incoherencies and for downgrading the moral individuals wellbeing in some previously unnoticed ways by contrast this book defends a distinctive intuitive and symmetric ethical principle according to which we should balance selfconcern with concern for others but it also concludes that there is contrary to utilitarianism no single basis for status as a virtue nor any simple relation between the virtues and human wellbeing,4

In love with a very proper lawyer, she had refused to marry him until she solved the mystery of her parentage. Somehow she had to find the answers to questions that had haunted her for years; Who had left her, a young baby, in a shadowy corner of a Hudson River warehouse? Why had she been abandoned?

Among those who answered her advertisement was Carl Dietrich, a television newsman. Although he disclaimed any knowledge of her origins, he offered to help her in her search. Katherine, however, had an uneasy feeling that he was not dealing straightforwardly with her. Her instinct was correct. He had his own reasons for not wanting her to learn who her parents were - reasons that involved a secret so sinister that it could mean death to anyone who stumbled on the truth.

The young college-bound kid had been hit by a car. He was almost, if not already, dead when Martin Arkenhout smashed his head with a stone.

With this chilling opening scene, Michael Pye begins a daring and suspenseful novel about the fragile borders that define who we are and the hidden desire in each of us to reinvent ourselves. When Arkenhout can no longer maintain the identity of his first victim, he takes another. Then another. He thinks he can live their lives better than they do, and he continues the pattern until he happens to choose the wrong victim and his secret begins to unravel.

We are taken from New York to the Bahamas to Amsterdam, and finally to Portugal, where Arkenhout (now living the life of one Professor Christopher Hart) is eventually tracked down by the story's narrator, John Costa, who is in pursuit of the real Hart because of a theft he committed. Costa has his own set of troubling circumstances: a failing marriage, the slow uncovering of his tormented family history, and a growing desire to leave it all behind by tasting Arkenhout's brand of dangerous freedom.","['Impostors and imposture', 'Fiction', 'Serial murderers', 'Young men', 'Identity (Psychology)', 'Impersonation', 'Murder', 'Fiction, suspense', 'Fiction, psychological', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, general', 'Fiction, thrillers, general', 'Serial murders, fiction', 'Private investigators, fiction', 'Large type books', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Fiction, thrillers, suspense']",,,,,['OL21226A'],13,a riveting psychological novel about a young serial killer who takes on the identities of his victims the first one he didnt really have to kill the young collegebound kid had been hit by a car he was almost if not already dead when martin arkenhout smashed his head with a stone with this chilling opening scene michael pye begins a daring and suspenseful novel about the fragile borders that define who we are and the hidden desire in each of us to reinvent ourselves when arkenhout can no longer maintain the identity of his first victim he takes another then another he thinks he can live their lives better than they do and he continues the pattern until he happens to choose the wrong victim and his secret begins to unravel we are taken from new york to the bahamas to amsterdam and finally to portugal where arkenhout now living the life of one professor christopher hart is eventually tracked down by the storys narrator john costa who is in pursuit of the real hart because of a theft he committed costa has his own set of troubling circumstances a failing marriage the slow uncovering of his tormented family history and a growing desire to leave it all behind by tasting arkenhouts brand of dangerous freedom,7

The royalty of Negro vaudeville,"""The Whitman Sisters were the highest paid act on the Negro Vaudeville Circuit, Theater Owner Booking Association (Toby), and one of the longest surviving touring companies (1899-1942). The group was considered the greatest incubator of dancing talent for Negro shows on or off Toby, and significantly contributed to American theater and dance history.

In The Royalty of Negro Vaudeville, Nadine George-Graves provides a historical narrative of their achievements and uses black feminist theories, feminist theories of performance, and theories of class and popular culture to analyze the many layers of performance in which the Whitman Sisters participated, on and off the stage. She shows that these four black women manipulated their race, gender, and class to resist hegemonic forces while achieving success.

Du contrat social,"*The Social Contract*, originally published as *On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Right* (French: *Du contrat social; ou, Principes du droit politique*), is a 1762 French-language book by the Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The book theorizes about the best way to establish a political community in the face of the problems of commercial society, which Rousseau had already identified in his *Discourse on Inequality* (1755).

*The Social Contract* helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. *The Social Contract* argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate. Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right.

"Killer Heat (Alexandra Cooper, #10)","It's August in New York, and the only thing that's hotter than the pavement is Manhattan D.A. Alex Cooper's professional and personal life. Just as she's claiming an especially gratifying victory in a rape case, she gets the call: the body of a young woman has been found in an abandoned building.  The brutality of the murder is disturbing enough, but when a second body, beaten and disposed of in exactly same manner, is found off the Belt Parkway, the city's top brass want the killer found fast, before the tabloids can start churning out ghoulish serial killer headlines.Between dodging the bullets of the gang members who are infuriated by Alex's most recent courtroom victory and keeping a rendezvous with a charming restaurateur, a serial killer on the loose is the last thing she needs on her plate right now. Then a third victim is found, and it becomes clear to Alex and her team that time is not on their side.Through Alex's peerless interrogation skills--and one big break--the search becomes focused on someone who has a twisted obsession with the military, and things grow increasingly dangerous when the chase leads to a chain of small, abandoned islands around New York harbor.Once again Linda Fairstein brilliantly orchestrates a page-turning mix of cutting-edgelegal issuesand forensics, New York City history, and spine-tingling suspense. And at the center of it all is Alex Cooper--stunning, single-minded, accomplished, and not to be trifled with whether she's in or out of a courtroom.","['Public prosecutors in fiction', 'Serial murderers in fiction', 'Fiction', 'Alexandra Cooper (Fictitious character)', 'Public prosecutors', 'Serial murderers']",['New York (N.Y.)'],,,,['OL2630622A'],10,its august in new york and the only thing thats hotter than the pavement is manhattan da alex coopers professional and personal life just as shes claiming an especially gratifying victory in a rape case she gets the call the body of a young woman has been found in an abandoned building the brutality of the murder is disturbing enough but when a second body beaten and disposed of in exactly same manner is found off the belt parkway the citys top brass want the killer found fast before the tabloids can start churning out ghoulish serial killer headlinesbetween dodging the bullets of the gang members who are infuriated by alexs most recent courtroom victory and keeping a rendezvous with a charming restaurateur a serial killer on the loose is the last thing she needs on her plate right now then a third victim is found and it becomes clear to alex and her team that time is not on their sidethrough alexs peerless interrogation skillsand one big breakthe search becomes focused on someone who has a twisted obsession with the military and things grow increasingly dangerous when the chase leads to a chain of small abandoned islands around new york harboronce again linda fairstein brilliantly orchestrates a pageturning mix of cuttingedgelegal issuesand forensics new york city history and spinetingling suspense and at the center of it all is alex cooperstunning singleminded accomplished and not to be trifled with whether shes in or out of a courtroom,6

In this second-to-last play of his illustrious career, Moliere satirizes ""foolish"" intellectualism, social climbing, and pretentious learning. Although Les Femmes Savantes is best understood in the social context of 1672, it poses a most contemporary question: What is the proper equilibrium between intellectual pursuits and everyday life?

Reservation blues,"In 1931, Robert Johnson allegedly sold his soul to the devil, receiving legendary blues skills in return. He went on to record only twenty-nine songs before being murdered on August 16, 1938. In 1992, however, Johnson suddenly appears on the Spokane Indian Reservation and meets Thomas Builds-the-Fire, the misfit storyteller of the Spokane Tribe.

So begins Reservation Blues, the mythic and musical tale of Coyote Springs, an all-Indian Catholic rock-and-roll band. With Thomas Builds-the-Fire as lead singer, Victor Joseph and Junior Polatkin on lead guitar and drums, and Chess and Checkers Warm Water on vocals, Coyote Springs takes their ""four-and-a-half-chord rock and blues"" to reservation bars, small town taverns, and the urban landscapes of Seattle and Manhattan.

The end of sanity,"Watching the nation's tradition of fairness and individuality decline, Martin L. Gross describes how it is giving way to a reign of conformity and error, including the insidious ""Political Correctness."" The crisis he describes goes beyond an attack on reason - actually heralding the end of sanity in American life.

Spearheaded by what he calls the ""New Establishment"" - a coalition of anti-intellectual academics, bureaucrats, politicians, judges, military leaders, social workers - the concepts that made America great are being thrown onto the cultural scrap heap in favor of a new ""experimental"" society that favors the few and ignores the many.

Gross argues passionately, with fact and reason that the theories of the New Establishment, which have gained control of virtually every American institution, are a peril to society. One result is that they have replaced the ideal of a single America with separatism. In The End of Sanity, the New Establishment is unmasked as a secular theocracy, a pseudo-religion that gains its power through dogma, which it demands be enforced.

But, says the author, there is a cure for America's ailment once we have diagnosed how deeply social and cultural insanity have infected the nation. Gross gets to the root of the problem, including examining the ""gods"" of the New Establishment, then provides remedies that can reverse the wrong-headedness.","['Social conditions', 'Moral conditions', 'Social values', 'Social problems', 'United states, social conditions', 'Popular culture, united states', 'United states, social conditions, 1980-', 'United states, moral conditions']",['United States'],,['1980-'],,['OL30847A'],7,watching the nations tradition of fairness and individuality decline martin l gross describes how it is giving way to a reign of conformity and error including the insidious political correctness the crisis he describes goes beyond an attack on reason actually heralding the end of sanity in american life spearheaded by what he calls the new establishment a coalition of antiintellectual academics bureaucrats politicians judges military leaders social workers the concepts that made america great are being thrown onto the cultural scrap heap in favor of a new experimental society that favors the few and ignores the many gross argues passionately with fact and reason that the theories of the new establishment which have gained control of virtually every american institution are a peril to society one result is that they have replaced the ideal of a single america with separatism in the end of sanity the new establishment is unmasked as a secular theocracy a pseudoreligion that gains its power through dogma which it demands be enforced but says the author there is a cure for americas ailment once we have diagnosed how deeply social and cultural insanity have infected the nation gross gets to the root of the problem including examining the gods of the new establishment then provides remedies that can reverse the wrongheadedness,18

To the last man,"Jeff Shaara has enthralled readers with his New York Times bestselling novels set during the Civil War and the American Revolution. Now the acclaimed author turns to World War I, bringing to life the sweeping, emotional story of the war that devastated a generation and established America as a world power.Spring 1916: the horror of a stalemate on Europe's western front. France and Great Britain are on one side of the barbed wire, a fierce German army is on the other. Shaara opens the window onto the otherworldly tableau of trench warfare as seen through the eyes of a typical British soldier who experiences the bizarre and the horrible--a ""Tommy"" whose innocent youth is cast into the hell of a terrifying war. In the skies, meanwhile, technology has provided a devastating new tool, the aeroplane, and with it a different kind of hero emerges--the flying ace. Soaring high above the chaos on the ground, these solitary knights duel in the splendor and terror of the skies, their courage and steel tested with every flight.As the conflict stretches into its third year, a neutral America is goaded into war, its reluctant president, Woodrow Wilson, finally accepting the repeated challenges to his stance of nonalignment. Yet the Americans are woefully unprepared and ill equipped to enter a war that has become worldwide in scope. The responsibility is placed on the shoulders of General John ""Blackjack"" Pershing, and by mid-1917 the first wave of the American Expeditionary Force arrives in Europe. Encouraged by the bold spirit and strength of the untested Americans, the world waits to see if the tide of war can finally be turned.From Blackjack Pershing to the Marine in the trenches, from the Red Baron to the American pilots of the Lafayette Escadrille, To the Last Man is written with the moving vividness and accuracy that characterizes all of Shaara's work.

A magnificent fight,"Soon after Japanese carrier-based planes attacked the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Japanese land-based bombers pounded Wake Island, an American advanced base that was key to the U.S. Navy's strategy in the Pacific. Throughout the next two weeks Japanese planes bombed Wake almost daily, but its determined defenders held out, providing a badly needed lift to American morale.

The author examines the defense plans prepared before the war and how grim necessity compelled the modification of those plans. The central part of the work recounts how the Wake garrison survived nearly daily bombings and repulsed the first Japanese attempt to take the atoll. This small band of defenders consisted of marines from an understrength defense battalion and a composite aviation unit equipped with a dwindling number of fighter planes, augmented by sailors and civilian volunteers.

An army signal corps radio unit was the island's only contact with the outside world.

This is the first American study of Wake's defense to use extensive Japanese materials - many never before tapped or previously unavailable to Western historians - to identify the enemy order of battle and the roles each unit played in the drama. The book also examines the atoll's development as a strategic American base.

Readers specifically interested in World War II, the Pacific war, and Navy/Marine Corps history will enjoy this book, as will a more general audience drawn to fast-moving stories of quiet courage in the face of tremendous odds.","['United States', 'United States.

Nothing Sacred,"Many disaffected Jews looking for an intelligent inquiry into spirituality have turned elsewhere, or nowhere. Meanwhile, faced with the chaos of modern life, returnees run back to Judaism with a blind and desperate faith and are quickly absorbed by outreach organizations that--in return for money--offer that those who adhere to this righteous path will never have to ask themselves another difficult question again. Ironically, Judaism was designed to avoid just such a scenario. Jewish tradition stresses transparency, open-ended inquiry, assimilation of the foreign, and a commitment to conscious living.

Pedophiles and Priests,"If we can believe the six o'clock news, there has been an epidemic of sexual abuse among the clergy, and especially among the Roman Catholic clergy. We have certainly seen many well-publicized cases, with front-page photos of priests led off to jail, and television interviews of parents afraid to let their children associate with clergy. But did the news media get the story right? Is there really an epidemic of clergy sex abuse?

And is there, as some charge, something about the institution of the priesthood itself that attracts or creates pedophiles?

Neither an expose nor an apology, Pedophiles and Priests takes a close, dispassionate look at the entire history of this mushrooming scandal, from the first rumblings to today's headlines. Philip Jenkins has written a fascinating, exhaustive, and above all even-handed account that not only puts this particular crisis in perspective, but offers an eye-opening look at the way in which an issue takes hold of the popular imagination.

Jenkins argues convincingly not only that clergy sex abuse is far less widespread than the headlines suggest, but that there is nothing at all particularly Roman Catholic about the problem.","['Child sexual abuse by clergy', 'United States', 'Clergy', 'Sexual behavior', 'Catholic Church', 'Kind', 'Pedofilie', 'Priesters', 'Rooms-Katholieke Kerk', 'Klerus', 'Sexueller Missbrauch', 'Child sexual abuse', 'Clergy, sexual behavior', 'Catholic church, clergy', 'Catholic church, united states', 'New York Times reviewed']",['United States'],,,,['OL21687A'],10,if we can believe the six oclock news there has been an epidemic of sexual abuse among the clergy and especially among the roman catholic clergy we have certainly seen many wellpublicized cases with frontpage photos of priests led off to jail and television interviews of parents afraid to let their children associate with clergy but did the news media get the story right is there really an epidemic of clergy sex abuse and is there as some charge something about the institution of the priesthood itself that attracts or creates pedophiles neither an expose nor an apology pedophiles and priests takes a close dispassionate look at the entire history of this mushrooming scandal from the first rumblings to todays headlines philip jenkins has written a fascinating exhaustive and above all evenhanded account that not only puts this particular crisis in perspective but offers an eyeopening look at the way in which an issue takes hold of the popular imagination jenkins argues convincingly not only that clergy sex abuse is far less widespread than the headlines suggest but that there is nothing at all particularly roman catholic about the problem,14

Εὐθύφρων / Κρίτων / Ἀπολογία Σωκράτους,"These new translations present Plato's remarkable dramatization of the momentous events surrounding the trial of Socrates in 399 BC, on charges of irreligion and corrupting the young. The Euthyphro, Defence of Socrates, and Crito form a dramatic and thematic sequence, raising fundamental questions about the basis of moral, religious, legal, and political obligation. Plato explores these issues with a freshness and directness that have never been surpassed.

In the Defence of Socrates, Plato seeks not only to clear his master's name, but also to defend the whole Socratic way of life, and therefore philosophy itself. The Euthyphro, an inquiry into the nature of piety, probes the relationship between religion and morality. The Crito discusses the citizen's obligation to the state, in the context of a life-or-death issue confronting Socrates himself - whether or not to escape from prison.

In the major league draft of 1971, the first player chosen from the State of Oklahoma was Ron Williamson. When he signed with the Oakland A's, he said goodbye to his hometown of Ada and left to pursue his dreams of big league glory. Six years later he was back, his dreams broken by a bad arm and bad habits - drinking, drugs and women. He began to show signs of mental illness. Unable to keep a job, he moved in with his mother and slept 20 hours a day on her sofa. In 1982, a 21 year-old cocktail waitress in Ada named Debra Sue Carter was raped and murdered, and for five years the police could not solve the crime. For reasons that were never clear, they suspected Ron Williamson and his friend Dennis Fritz. The two were finally arrested in 1987 and charged with capital murder. With no physical evidence, the prosecution's case was built on junk science and the testimony of jaihouse snitches and convicts. Dennis Fritz was found guilty and given a life sentence. Ron Williamson was sent to Death Row. If you believe that in America you are innocent until proven guilty, this book will shock you. If you believe in the death penalty, this book will disturb you.

America's Victories,"From the Revolutionary War to the War on Terror, the American military has consistently beaten the odds. It's not luck.America's armed services are under attack. From college campuses to the floor of the Senate, the Iraq war is portrayed as a quagmire, the Army is described as ""broken,"" and our men and women in uniform are maligned as torturers. Hollywood keeps producing anti-war films, and the media celebrates liberal anti-military activists such as Cindy Sheehan.These critics fail to understand the real nature of the American military. By seeing everything through the distorted lens of Vietnam — a war shrouded in harmful myths —they have lost sight of our country's real military record, and the factors that have enabled us to win with remarkable consistency, in situations even more dire than Iraq.In America's Victories, Professor Larry Schweikart restores the truth about our amazing military heritage. Just as he did in his acclaimed previous book, A Patriot's History of the United States, Professor Schweikart cuts through the distortions passed along by academia and the media.Why do Americans win wars, and why is it all but certain we will win the War on Terror? The biggest answer is that, far from being a cruel, bloodthirsty nation, eager to acquire other people's resources, we value the sanctity of life more than any military culture in history. This fundamental trait has led, over the last two centuries, to more humane treatment of prisoners, more daring POW rescues, and more effective operations than any comparable power.The American military has also benefited from a combination of other virtues: the ability to learn from losses and mistakes; the unique autonomy entrusted to our troops; and, ironically, the constant improvements forced by anti-war protestors. When coupled with an unmatched free-market economy, America's fighting forces are fearsome.America's Victories explains how this culture of victory has endured through the darkest moments of World War II, Korean, and Vietnam, and how it has helped our troops prove their critics wrong over and over, from the Battle of New Orleans under Andrew Jackson to the war in Afghanistan under Tommy Franks. Among the book's many revelations, you'll learn:* How the military since the time of the Revolution has constituted an incredible ""melting pot"" of ethnicities and social classes, creating a culture blind to origins, but open to talent and desire.* How the Higgins Boat (key to the success of D-Day) and the Jeep (the backbone vehicle of World War II) were created by American entrepreneurs, not central planners, and how our economic capacity buried the Axis powers.* Why Abu Ghraib does NOT contradict our respect for individual human life, including our exceedingly humane treatment of prisoners of war, and how a better example of Americans' view of prisoners is the POW rescue at Canabantuan.* How anti-war protestors, by emphasizing ""body bags,"" have led our military inexorably toward more efficient operations that minimize casualties.* How Americans (not the French) put into practice Napoleon's maxim that ""every soldier carries a Marshal's baton in his knapsack,"" and made our front line troops the most autonomous fighters in history.Professor Schweikart acknowledges America's blemishes and weak moments, but also exposes the deep-seated anti-American bias of the Left. Based on the lessons of history, he concludes that we will win the War on Terror, through a weapon more powerful than any bomb or rocket: our unique military culture.","['History', 'Nonfiction', 'Military History', 'Civilization', 'American National characteristics', 'United states, history, military', 'National characteristics, american', 'United states, civilization']",,,,,['OL34929A'],7,from the revolutionary war to the war on terror the american military has consistently beaten the odds its not luckamericas armed services are under attack from college campuses to the floor of the senate the iraq war is portrayed as a quagmire the army is described as broken and our men and women in uniform are maligned as torturers hollywood keeps producing antiwar films and the media celebrates liberal antimilitary activists such as cindy sheehanthese critics fail to understand the real nature of the american military by seeing everything through the distorted lens of vietnam a war shrouded in harmful myths they have lost sight of our countrys real military record and the factors that have enabled us to win with remarkable consistency in situations even more dire than iraqin americas victories professor larry schweikart restores the truth about our amazing military heritage just as he did in his acclaimed previous book a patriots history of the united states professor schweikart cuts through the distortions passed along by academia and the mediawhy do americans win wars and why is it all but certain we will win the war on terror the biggest answer is that far from being a cruel bloodthirsty nation eager to acquire other peoples resources we value the sanctity of life more than any military culture in history this fundamental trait has led over the last two centuries to more humane treatment of prisoners more daring pow rescues and more effective operations than any comparable powerthe american military has also benefited from a combination of other virtues the ability to learn from losses and mistakes the unique autonomy entrusted to our troops and ironically the constant improvements forced by antiwar protestors when coupled with an unmatched freemarket economy americas fighting forces are fearsomeamericas victories explains how this culture of victory has endured through the darkest moments of world war ii korean and vietnam and how it has helped our troops prove their critics wrong over and over from the battle of new orleans under andrew jackson to the war in afghanistan under tommy franks among the books many revelations youll learn how the military since the time of the revolution has constituted an incredible melting pot of ethnicities and social classes creating a culture blind to origins but open to talent and desire how the higgins boat key to the success of dday and the jeep the backbone vehicle of world war ii were created by american entrepreneurs not central planners and how our economic capacity buried the axis powers why abu ghraib does not contradict our respect for individual human life including our exceedingly humane treatment of prisoners of war and how a better example of americans view of prisoners is the pow rescue at canabantuan how antiwar protestors by emphasizing body bags have led our military inexorably toward more efficient operations that minimize casualties how americans not the french put into practice napoleons maxim that every soldier carries a marshals baton in his knapsack and made our front line troops the most autonomous fighters in historyprofessor schweikart acknowledges americas blemishes and weak moments but also exposes the deepseated antiamerican bias of the left based on the lessons of history he concludes that we will win the war on terror through a weapon more powerful than any bomb or rocket our unique military culture,16

Metadiscourse,"""First released in 2005, Ken Hyland's Metadiscourse has become a canonical account of how language is used in written communication. 'Metadiscourse' is defined as the ways that writers reflect on their texts to refer to themselves, their readers or the text itself. It is a key resource in language as it allows the writer to engage with readers in familiar and expected ways and as such it is an important tool for students of academic writing in both the L1 and L2 context. This book achieves for main goals: - to provide an accessible introduction to metadiscourse, discussing its role and importance in written communication and reviewing current thinking on the topic - to explore examples of metadiscourse in a range of texts from business, academic, journalistic, and student writing - to offer a new theory of metadiscourse - to show the relevance of this theory to students, academics and language teachers. The book shows how writers use the devices of metadiscourse to adjust the level of personality in their texts, to offer a representation of themselves and their arguments. It shows how these tools help the reader organise, interpret and evaluate the information presented in the text. Knowing how to identify metadiscourse as a reader is a key skill to be learnt by students of discourse analysis and this book makes this a central goal.""--Bloomsbury Publishing.","['Written communication', 'Discourse analysis', 'Rhetoric', 'Authorship', 'Composition (Language arts)', 'Writing']",,,,,['OL29228A'],6,first released in 2005 ken hylands metadiscourse has become a canonical account of how language is used in written communication metadiscourse is defined as the ways that writers reflect on their texts to refer to themselves their readers or the text itself it is a key resource in language as it allows the writer to engage with readers in familiar and expected ways and as such it is an important tool for students of academic writing in both the l1 and l2 context this book achieves for main goals to provide an accessible introduction to metadiscourse discussing its role and importance in written communication and reviewing current thinking on the topic to explore examples of metadiscourse in a range of texts from business academic journalistic and student writing to offer a new theory of metadiscourse to show the relevance of this theory to students academics and language teachers the book shows how writers use the devices of metadiscourse to adjust the level of personality in their texts to offer a representation of themselves and their arguments it shows how these tools help the reader organise interpret and evaluate the information presented in the text knowing how to identify metadiscourse as a reader is a key skill to be learnt by students of discourse analysis and this book makes this a central goalbloomsbury publishing,4

It took them a long time to gather themselves into a whole, with the shape and the subtle interconnections that make a bunch of stories into a book.

""Recently I have published two collections of science-fiction stories. The stories in Unlocking the Air aren't science fiction; they belong variously to plain realism, or magical realism, or surrealism, or postmodern genres that don't even have names yet. They approach reality sometimes frontally, confrontationally, in daylight; sometimes deviously, by a back road in the dark; but they always approach it.

Some take place in realistic settings, such as the central European country of Orsinia or the town of Ether, OR. Others take place in highly fantastic settings, such as Oakland, Cleveland, or Portland. Several of them use a multiple voice, or a mythic voice, to talk about reality, because reality is a slippery fish that often can be caught only in a net of spells, or with the hook of metaphor.

Sons and Lovers,"<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i>, a story of working-class England, is <a href=""https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/d-h-lawrence""><abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence’s</a> third novel. It went through various drafts, and was titled “Paul Morel” until the final draft, before being published and met with an indifferent reaction from contemporary critics. Modern critics now consider it to be <abbr>D. H.</abbr> Lawrence’s masterpiece, with the Modern Library placing it ninth in its “100 Best English-Language Novels of the 20th Century.”</p>
			<p>The novel follows the Morels, a family living in a coal town, and headed by a passionate but boorish miner. His wife, originally from a refined family, is dragged down by Morel’s classlessness, and finds her life’s joy in her children. As the children grow up and start leading lives of their own, they struggle against their mother’s emotional drain on them.</p>
			<p><i>Sons and Lovers</i> was written during a period in Lawrence’s life when his own mother was gravely ill. Its exploration of the Oedipal instinct, frank depiction of working-class household unhappiness and violence, and accurate and colorful depiction of Nottinghamshire dialect, make it a fascinating window into the life of people not often chronicled in fiction of the day.</p>","['Fiction', 'England in fiction', 'Working class families', 'Young men in fiction', 'Working class families in fiction', 'Young men', 'Facsimiles', 'Social life and customs', 'England', 'Manuscripts', 'English Manuscripts', 'Coal mines and mining', 'Domestic fiction', 'Coal mines and mining in fiction', 'Customs and Manners', 'Classic Literature', 'Mothers and sons', 'Married women', 'Possessiveness', 'Coal miners', 'open_syllabus_project', 'Working class families -- Fiction', 'Young men -- Fiction', 'England -- Fiction', 'British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'England, fiction', 'Fiction, family life', 'Fiction, coming of age', 'Fiction, biographical', 'Large type books', 'Fiction, family life, general', 'Lawrence, d. h.

Robbie,"""Robbie"" is a science fiction short story by American writer Isaac Asimov. It was his first robot story and writing commenced on June 10, 1939. It was first published in the September 1940 issue Super Science Stories magazine as ""Strange Playfellow"", a title that was chosen by editor Frederik Pohl and described as ""distasteful"" by Asimov. A revised version of ""Robbie"" was reprinted under Asimov's original title in the collections [I, Robot](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL46241W) (1950), [The Complete Robot](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL46368W) (1982), and [Robot Visions](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL46337W) (1990). ""Robbie"" was the fourteenth story written by Asimov, and the ninth to be published. The story is also part of Asimov's Robot series, and was the first of Asimov's positronic robot stories to see publication.

The story centers on the technophobia that surrounds robots, and how it is misplaced. Almost all previously published science fiction stories featuring robots followed the theme 'robot turns against creator'; Asimov has consistently held the belief that the Frankenstein complex was a misplaced fear, and the majority of his works attempted to provide examples of the help that robots could provide humanity.

In 2016 Robbie won a retrospective 1941 Hugo Award for best short story.

This is a language where 'cleave' can mean to cut in half or to hold two halves together; where the simple word 'set' has 126 different meanings as a verb, 58 as a noun, and 10 as a participial adjective; where if you can run fast you are moving swiftly, but if you are stuck fast you are not moving at all; [and] where 'colonel,' 'freight,' 'once,' and 'ache' are strikingly at odds with their spellings."" As a copy editor for the London Times in the early 1980s, Bill Bryson felt keenly the lack of an easy-to-consult, authoritative guide to avoiding the traps and snares in English, and so he brashly suggested to a publisher that he should write one. Surprisingly, the proposition was accepted, and for ""a sum of money carefully gauged not to cause embarrassment or feelings of overworth,"" he proceeded to write that book--his first, inaugurating his stellar career.Now, a decade and a half later, revised, updated, and thoroughly (but not overly) Americanized, it has become Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words, more than ever an essential guide to the wonderfully disordered thing that is the English language.

Histoire du paradis,"""We hold Christ's cross and Adam's tree to be in one place,"" wrote John Donne, speaking of the location of the Garden of Eden. Milton thought it ""below the Ethiope line"" (the equator). And every schoolchild once knew it was at the summit of Dante's ""seven storey mountain"" of the Purgatorio. Not only the location of the ""earthly paradise"" but its significance, historical and theological, preoccupied the collective mind and imagination of Europe for at least fifteen-hundred years.

Jean Delumeau has devoted himself to understanding the fears that have beset Western thinkers, particularly since the medieval period: how they arose, whether from nature, other human beings, or from some other world.

This History of Paradise continues the questioning, telling the story of how the Western mind from the late middle ages to the early modern period conceived the meaning and the place of primordial bliss.

The Wealth of Nations,"Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations was recognized as a landmark of human thought upon its publication in 1776. As the first scientific argument for the principles of political economy, it is the point of departure for all subsequent economic thought. Smith's theories of capital accumulation, growth, and secular change, among others, continue to be influential in modern economics.

"News from Nowhere, or, An epoch of rest","News from Nowhere (1890) is the most famous work of one of the greatest British writers and thinkers, William Morris. It is a utopian picture of a future communist society, drawing on the work of Ruskin and Marx and written in response to what Morris saw as soulless and mechanical visions of socialism.

In this work of his last years, Morris distilled many of his leading ideas on politics, art and society, imagining a world in which capitalism has been abolished by a workers' revolution and nature and society have become beautiful habitations for humanity. In an era that has seen the collapse of state socialism, Morris's damning critique of this conception, and his positing of a powerful alternative, are compelling reasons for paying attention to this classic of British socialism.","['Utopias', 'Socialism', 'Classic Literature', 'Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fiction, short stories (single author)', 'Fiction, sagas', 'Utopies', 'Utopie', 'Utopian literature', 'Great britain, social conditions']",,['William Morris (1834-1896)'],,"April 30, 2004",['OL28409A'],12,news from nowhere 1890 is the most famous work of one of the greatest british writers and thinkers william morris it is a utopian picture of a future communist society drawing on the work of ruskin and marx and written in response to what morris saw as soulless and mechanical visions of socialism in this work of his last years morris distilled many of his leading ideas on politics art and society imagining a world in which capitalism has been abolished by a workers revolution and nature and society have become beautiful habitations for humanity in an era that has seen the collapse of state socialism morriss damning critique of this conception and his positing of a powerful alternative are compelling reasons for paying attention to this classic of british socialism,4

Claire Hayden has no idea that her world is about to be shattered. At the conclusion of her husband's fortieth birthday party, he is found murdered. He has no enemies. He has committed no crimes. He has no shady past. Or, at least that's what Claire thinks...

Someone has been killing this way for decades. Someone who will do anything to make certain no one finds out. The mystery brings them from San Francisco, to New York, to London, and to a tangled web of secrets, family intrigue, and a jealous heir whose murderous impulses don't stop with the first killing. Is Claire unknowingly connected to the killer? Does Ian Marshall know more than he can say? And Ian proves himself to be a dangerous man: dangerous to Claire's mind, heart, and emotions.

The Constant Princess,"Splendid and sumptuous historical novel from this internationally bestselling author, telling of the early life of Katherine of Aragon.

We think of her as the barren wife of a notorious king; but behind this legacy lies a fascinating story. Katherine of Aragon is born Catalina, the Spanish Infanta, to parents who are both rulers and warriors. Aged four, she is betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, and is raised to be Queen of England. She is never in doubt that it is her destiny to rule that far-off, wet, cold land. Her faith is tested when her prospective father-in-law greets her arrival in her new country with a great insult; Arthur seems little better than a boy; the food is strange and the customs coarse.

Slowly she adapts to the first Tudor court, and life as Arthur’s wife grows ever more bearable. But when the studious young man dies, she is left to make her own future: how can she now be queen, and found a dynasty? Only by marrying Arthur’s young brother, the sunny but spoilt Henry.

His father and grandmother are against it; her powerful parents prove little use. Yet Katherine is her mother’s daughter and her fighting spirit is strong. She will do anything to achieve her aim; even if it means telling the greatest lie, and holding to it.

Philippa Gregory proves yet again that behind the apparently familiar face of history lies an astonishing story: of women warriors influencing the future of Europe, of revered heroes making deep mistakes, and of an untold love story which changes the fate of a nation.","['Fiction', 'Catharine, in fiction', 'Great Britain in fiction', 'Henry in fiction', 'Queens in fiction', 'History', 'Queens', 'Biographical fiction', 'Historical fiction', 'Large type books', 'Roman historique', 'Reines', 'Roman', 'Fiction, historical, general', 'Fiction, biographical', 'England, fiction']",['Great Britain'],"['Catharine of Aragon, Queen, consort of Henry VIII, King of England (1485-1536)', 'Henry VIII King of England (1491-1547)']","['Henry VIII, 1509-1547']",,['OL31358A'],10,splendid and sumptuous historical novel from this internationally bestselling author telling of the early life of katherine of aragon we think of her as the barren wife of a notorious king but behind this legacy lies a fascinating story katherine of aragon is born catalina the spanish infanta to parents who are both rulers and warriors aged four she is betrothed to arthur prince of wales and is raised to be queen of england she is never in doubt that it is her destiny to rule that faroff wet cold land her faith is tested when her prospective fatherinlaw greets her arrival in her new country with a great insult arthur seems little better than a boy the food is strange and the customs coarse slowly she adapts to the first tudor court and life as arthurs wife grows ever more bearable but when the studious young man dies she is left to make her own future how can she now be queen and found a dynasty only by marrying arthurs young brother the sunny but spoilt henry his father and grandmother are against it her powerful parents prove little use yet katherine is her mothers daughter and her fighting spirit is strong she will do anything to achieve her aim even if it means telling the greatest lie and holding to it philippa gregory proves yet again that behind the apparently familiar face of history lies an astonishing story of women warriors influencing the future of europe of revered heroes making deep mistakes and of an untold love story which changes the fate of a nation,7

Does up-to-date exegesis challenge his virginal conception and personal resurrection? Can one reconcile Jesus' role as universal Saviour with the truth and values to be found in other religions? What should the feminist movement highlight in presenting Jesus?

The Darkest Heart,"She was called the bell of the Southwest

Beautiful Candice Carter enjoyed the attentions of every eligible man in the New Mexico Territory, until her reckless heart led her to near death in the desert. But rescue came from a savage...Jack Savage, the hard-muscled Indian warrior who both terrified and fascinated her. Suddenly she was at the mercy of an arrogant halfbreed whose forbidden passion she dared not admit she wanted to taste.

He was called Savage

From the moment he saw her, Jack branded Candice his woman. No matter that he had chosen the Indian way...no matter that he could hang for touching her. nothing could stop him from making her his reluctant bride. Vowing to teach her every sensual pleasure, he set out to tame the fiery spirit of the blond beauty who had stolen his soul. But as war raged between the white man and the Apache, he found himself torn between duty to his people and a forbidden love he could not resist and could not live without.

**AUTHOR’S NOTE**

*… every Apache man, wherever found, should be killed on sight and the women and children sold into slavery.*
—COLONEL BAYLOR, Confederate Governor of the Arizona Territory of President Jefferson Davis

*The men [Apaches and Navajos] are to be slain where found. The women and children are to be taken prisoner, but, of course, they are not to be killed.*
—Standing orders of General Carleton to all men under his command during the “Slaughtering Sixties”

*When I was young, I walked all over this country and saw no people other than Apaches. After many summers I walked again and found another race of people who had come to take it. How is it?
Why is it the Apaches want to die—that they carry their lives in their fingernails? They roam over the hills and plains and want the heavens to fall on them. The Apaches were once a great nation; they are now but a few … many have died in battle … Tell me, if the Virgin Mary has walked throughout all the land, why has she never entered the lodge of the Apache?*
—COCHISE, September 1871, shortly before his final surrender to President Grant’s personal representative

Cochise surrendered in October 1871. He died three years later.
The events of February 1861 as I have recounted them are accurate within the bounds of historical controversy. The army denied, up until the turn of the century—when the issue became irrelevant—that Lieutenant Bascom flew a white flag and betrayed Cochise purposefully. Those fate-filled days of February, referred to by some historians as Bascom’s Folly and considered by those same historians to have directly triggered Cochise’s war with the white man, did begin with the kidnapping of the son of a Sonoita rancher’s common-law wife. Possibly the boy was fathered by a Coyotero, possibly by a man from a previous marraige. The rancher accused Cochise of the kidnapping, and later it was found that the Coyoteros did indeed kidnap the boy, who later gained fame as the Apache scout Mickey Free.
The cast of characters who are real personages are as follows: Pete Kitchen, William S. Oury, William Buckley, Wallace, Culver, and Welsh, Lieutenant Bascom, Geronimo, Nahilzay, Cochise’s family, and Cochise.
The fate of the rancher whom I called Warden was pure fiction, as was the fate of Lieutenant Morris, who was based on the actual lieutenant Moore. Moore brought reinforcements from Fort Breckenridge and finally ordered the hangings of the six Apaches. All the events of those days in February are as accurate as possible, based on the problem of deciding between conflicting versions of historians. It is possible Bascom did not fly a white flag. However, Cochise was at peace with the whites using Apache Pass—in fact, the Chiricahua supplied the Butterfield Station with wood. Some historians have written that Cochise was at peace only with the Butterfield Overland Mail and warred on other whites. I found more evidence to show him as I have.
A few minor points might be inaccurate. Some accounts states that Cochise and five braves greeted Bascom, not Cochise and his relatives, wife, and son. One account held that Cochise had six prisoners, not three, and the reason six Apaches were hanged was in direct retaliation for finding the six (not three) mutilated corpses.
For ten years Cochise and his warriors brought devastation upon the settlers and troops of the New Mexico Territory. Other tribes, led by other chiefs, fought for their freedom as well. But it was a losing battle. The Apaches were being exterminated slowly but surely, and in the process of hit-and-run warfare, they were also starving. After Cochise crushingly defeated the army’s best column of Indian fighters, led by Lieutenant Howard Cushing, who was also killed in the attack, the army decided upon a policy of conciliation. President Grant’s personal representative was sent to negotiate a peace with Cochise, who met with him and accepted the terms. The Chiricahua were promised that they could stay in their own land, but several months after the peace they were removed to Tularosa, New Mexico. They later fled back into their own mountains.
While General George Crook began his vicious, unrelenting, and eventually successful campaign against the Tonto Apaches, General O. O. Howard and the famous frontiersman and ex-scout, Captain Tom Jeffords (who was also Cochise’s blood brother) negotiated another surrender from him. This time the Chiricahua got most of the land that was theirs as their reservation, and Jeffords was their agent.
But all the government’s promises did not materialize. The schools, hospitals, trading posts, supplies, and food never appeared. What food did come was the wrong kind, such as wheat, with which the Apaches were unfamiliar and did not know how to cook. Game was scarce, the Apaches were starving. Young braves resorted more and more to whiskey, and under its influence even continued to raid south. When two American whiskey peddlers were killed on the reservation, Congress took action, Jeffords was removed as the Indian agent, and the government prepared to remove the Chiricahuas to the swampland of the San Carlos reservation.
Cochise was dead. His son, Tahzay, and several other headmen were in favor of submission. Geronimo, Juh, and Nolgee fled with their followers south to the Sierra Madres. About 325 remaining Chiricahuas were moved to San Carlos.
Geronimo and other renegades fought viciously and brutally for another ten years. In April 1886, the last renegades, including Geronimo, were captured and surrendered at Fort Bowie in Apache Pass. They were shipped to Fort Marion, Florida.
There they were forgotten for years. Eventually they were moved to Alabama, then Oklahoma, and finally some 250 survivors were allowed to return to the Mescalero reservation in New Mexico. They were all that remained of what was originally a population of close to fifteen hundred. The government’s policy of extermination had almost been fulfilled.
I would like to add a final note. After I had written the first draft of this novel and was doing further research on the Apaches, I stumbled across an article at the Arizona Historical Society, written by Professor R. A. Mulligan of the University of Arizona. He states that just prior to the events of February 1861, there were three Chiricahua chiefs; Cochise, Esconolea, and a man named Jack.…","['collectionID:Wbodice_ripper', 'Fiction, romance,

The letters of D.H. Lawrence,"Lawrence's renowned creativity is conspicuous in his letters. Here in over 330 of them - many first published in the acclaimed seven-volume Cambridge Edition - are exemplified the remarkable variety and inventiveness he could command. He corresponded with the elite - aristocrats, fellow authors, painters, publishers and others from the intelligentsia; but not with these only.

With equal concern he wrote to his sisters, a childhood friend suffering from tuberculosis, a Post Office clerk or an Italian servant-girl. Lawrence revelled in the act of communication, using a direct, unvarnished but invariably vivid style appropriate to each correspondent. His letters are notable for expressive and imaginative energy, wit and comedy, the tender and the tempestuous, combined with an extraordinary sensitivity to the natural world as well as to the human condition - and much besides.

Few English letter-writers offer a comparable range of interest. In his introductory essay James Boulton provides a rare critical assessment of Lawrence's epistolary achievement.

Sexual strategies,"Why do women and men lie to each other? Why do many men try to control women? Why do women and men have different sexual fantasies? Why are so many women attracted to wealthy, powerful men? Is it inevitable that men love to look at young, voluptuous women? The obvious answers to these questions tell only a small part of the story.

In Sexual Strategies, science journalist Mary Batten presents a provocative exploration of female/male behavior in the animal kingdom and its powerful implications for human relationships. Science increasingly acknowledges that much of human behavior is influenced by biology as well as culture. Human reproductive strategies in particular have come to look more like those of the birds and the bees than anyone imagined.

In actuality, it is the females, not the males, of many species that actively select their mates. Although Charles Darwin introduced the theory of female mate choice more than a century ago, only in recent years has this controversial idea been appreciated by the scientific community. Studies of female choice are demolishing the age-old myth of the passive female. From fruitflies to primates, Batten shows how female choice truly plays a pivotal role in the evolution of species.

By understanding female mate choice and the female's true power in evolution, we see our own complex species with greater clarity. We gain greater insight into why males and females, including men and women, have built-in conflicts in their mating behavior. In addition, Batten illuminates the roots of current social problems related to gender competition and shows that they cannot be fully understood outside a biological context.","['Mate selection', 'Courtship in animals', 'Psychology', 'Women', 'New York Times reviewed', 'Women, psychology', 'Animal behavior']",,,,,['OL31327A'],11,why do women and men lie to each other why do many men try to control women why do women and men have different sexual fantasies why are so many women attracted to wealthy powerful men is it inevitable that men love to look at young voluptuous women the obvious answers to these questions tell only a small part of the story in sexual strategies science journalist mary batten presents a provocative exploration of femalemale behavior in the animal kingdom and its powerful implications for human relationships science increasingly acknowledges that much of human behavior is influenced by biology as well as culture human reproductive strategies in particular have come to look more like those of the birds and the bees than anyone imagined in actuality it is the females not the males of many species that actively select their mates although charles darwin introduced the theory of female mate choice more than a century ago only in recent years has this controversial idea been appreciated by the scientific community studies of female choice are demolishing the ageold myth of the passive female from fruitflies to primates batten shows how female choice truly plays a pivotal role in the evolution of species by understanding female mate choice and the females true power in evolution we see our own complex species with greater clarity we gain greater insight into why males and females including men and women have builtin conflicts in their mating behavior in addition batten illuminates the roots of current social problems related to gender competition and shows that they cannot be fully understood outside a biological context,4

Not war but murder,"""On the morning of Friday, June 3, 1864, Generals Ulysses S. Grant and George G. Meade brought their overland campaign against Richmond to its climax in an all-out assault on Robert E. Lee's entrenched Rebels at Cold Harbor, less than ten miles outside the Confederate capital. The result was outright slaughter - Grant's worst defeat, and Lee's last great victory. Ernest Furgurson tells the story of this pivotal conflict.

Federal generals consume a champagne lunch while more than a thousand of their wounded lie untended on the field. The Confederate Congress votes itself a 100 percent pay raise while bread prices skyrocket in the South. An angry Union surgeon saws off the leg of a malingerer. Yankee and Rebel soldiers, slipping between the lines after dark to rescue the wounded, find themselves in the same hole and negotiate a private truce.

Cold Harbor was a watershed moment of the Civil War after Grant's defeat, the struggle dragged on; the war of maneuver became a war of siege, and stand-up attack gave way to trench warfare-tactics that would become familiar in France half a century later. Above all, Cold Harbor was the most uselessly bloody, one-sided battle of the war, whose terrible human cost is captured in one chilling diary entry, scrawled by a morally wounded soldier: ""June 3, Cold Harbor.

The arms maker of Berlin,"This powerfully suspenseful new novel from Dan Fesperman takes us deep into the early 1940s in Switzerland and Germany as it traces the long reach of the wartime intrigues of the White Rose student movement, which dared to speak out against Hitler.When Nat Turnbull, a history professor who specializes in the German resistance, gets the news that his estranged mentor, Gordon Wolfe, has been arrested for possession of stolen World War II archives, he's hardly surprised that, even at the age of eighty-four, Gordon has gotten himself in trouble. But what's in the archives is staggering: a spymaster's trove missing since the end of the war, one that Gordon has always claimed is full of ""secrets you can't find anywhere else . . . live ammunition.""Yet key documents are still missing, and Nat believes Gordon has hidden them. The FBI agrees, and when Gordon is found dead in jail, the Bureau dispatches Nat to track down the material, which has also piqued the interest of several dangerous competitors. As he follows a trail of cryptic clues left behind by Gordon, assisted by an attractive academic with questionable motives, Nat's quest takes him to Bern and Berlin, where his path soon crosses that of Kurt Bauer, an aging German arms merchant still hoarding his own wartime secrets.

Christian Science,"From the book:This last summer, when I was on my way back to Vienna from the Appetite-Cure in the mountains, I fell over a cliff in the twilight, and broke some arms and legs and one thing or another, and by good luck was found by some peasants who had lost an ass, and they carried me to the nearest habitation, which was one of those large, low, thatch-roofed farm-houses, with apartments in the garret for the family, and a cunning little porch under the deep gable decorated with boxes of bright colored flowers and cats; on the ground floor a large and light sitting-room, separated from the milch-cattle apartment by a partition; and in the front yard rose stately and fine the wealth and pride of the house, the manure-pile. That sentence is Germanic, and shows that I am acquiring that sort of mastery of the art and spirit of the language which enables a man to travel all day in one sentence without changing cars. There was a village a mile away, and a horse doctor lived there, but there was no surgeon. It seemed a bad outlook; mine was distinctly a surgery case. Then it was remembered that a lady from Boston was summering in that village, and she was a Christian Science doctor and could cure anything. So she was sent for. It was night by this time, and she could not conveniently come, but sent word that it was no matter, there was no hurry, she would give me ""absent treatment"" now, and come in the morning; meantime she begged me to make myself tranquil and comfor-table and remember that there was nothing the matter with me.

Observing that by 2050 all Americans will be minorities, Takaki urges us to ask ourselves: Will America fulfill the promise of equality or will America retreat into its ""iron cages"" and resist diversity, allowing racial conflicts to divide and possibly even destroy America as a nation?

The ownership solution,"Backed by a wide array of influential supporters from the worlds of business, finance, government, non-profits, and academia, The Ownership Solution is nothing less than a new capitalist manifesto - a blueprint for making the system of free enterprise really work.

To Jeff Gates, a pioneer in the field of employee ownership, the central problem of capitalism is that it doesn't create enough capitalists. In the United States, for example, despite rising living standards, full employment, low inflation, and a bull market that can't stop setting records, the gulf between the haves and the have-nots is widening.

Concentration of wealth at the top results in what Gates calls ""disconnected capitalism,"" and it will cause the system to implode, unless politicians, corporate executives, investors, social activists, and common citizens come up with creative strategies to make the system more inclusive.

Gates operates from the fundamental assumption that people are likely to become better stewards of all the systems of which they are part - social, political, fiscal, cultural, and natural - as they gain a personal stake in the economic system. Drawing from the experiences of over a dozen nations, Gates offers a set of strategy and policy recommendations to reinforce this trend toward capitalism by and for the people.","['Capitalism', 'Comparative economics', 'Property', 'Twenty-first century', 'United States', 'Kapitalisme', 'Mede-eigendom']",['United States'],,,,['OL34876A'],8,backed by a wide array of influential supporters from the worlds of business finance government nonprofits and academia the ownership solution is nothing less than a new capitalist manifesto a blueprint for making the system of free enterprise really work to jeff gates a pioneer in the field of employee ownership the central problem of capitalism is that it doesnt create enough capitalists in the united states for example despite rising living standards full employment low inflation and a bull market that cant stop setting records the gulf between the haves and the havenots is widening concentration of wealth at the top results in what gates calls disconnected capitalism and it will cause the system to implode unless politicians corporate executives investors social activists and common citizens come up with creative strategies to make the system more inclusive gates operates from the fundamental assumption that people are likely to become better stewards of all the systems of which they are part social political fiscal cultural and natural as they gain a personal stake in the economic system drawing from the experiences of over a dozen nations gates offers a set of strategy and policy recommendations to reinforce this trend toward capitalism by and for the people,4
With these hands,"The timeless fiction of Louis L'Amour  is both unforgettable and undeniably American, deftly capturing the heroic bravery and intrepid spirit that make this nation great. L'Amour 's legacy of work remains unparalleled, setting a standard of excellence that few other writers have matched.  Now With These Hands pulls together some of L'Amour's very best work--eleven newly rediscovered stories that have never before appeared in a single volume.

Here are tales of adventure, mystery, passion, suspense, and the Old West as only L'Amour  can tell them.  The result is a collection that profoundly echoes the highs and lows of the human experience, while proving that life's most vital moments can occur when and where we least expect them.All of the classic L'Amour themes are represented: honor, loyalty, and standing up for what's right despite the odds. These dramatic stories grab hold of the reader with a power and immediacy unsurpassed by any other writer. An exotic island in the Coral Sea is transformed into a tropical nightmare when it's taken over by a band of hijackers--and only a daredevil pilot can stop their brutal carnage. A former boxer blows the lid off a vicious crime ring--and finds that his worst enemy is not a thug with a gun but his own tenacious curiosity. A down-on-his-luck rancher discovers the key to his own redemption--and desperately hopes that his revelation has not come too late for him to win the one thing he wants most of all. A private eye navigates the twists and turns of a labyrinthine whodunit--and proves that the greatest risk to a man's honor is his own greed. The title story ""With These Hands"" is a powerful tale that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit, as an oil company executive finds himself the sole survivor of an Arctic plane crash. Fighting for his life against the perilous cold and looming starvation, he resists the temptation to surrender to death--only to discover a life-affirming strength he never knew he had.

Possessions,"This sequel to Julia Kristeva's celebrated allegory The Old Man and the Wolves returns to the corrupt seaside resort of a mythical town, where the boundaries between East and West, civilization and barbarism, and good and evil are erased. Part mystery, part meditation, this engrossing tale features the return of Parisian amateur detective and newspaper reporter Stephanie Delacour (Kristeva's alter ego), drawn into the mystery of a friend's murder.

The story opens with the gruesome discovery of the decapitated body of gifted translator Gloria Harrison. Delacour finds herself participating in the investigation in the company of Detective Superintendent Northrup Rilsky. As the mystery unfolds, Delacour veers away from Rilsky's investigation, on to a trail that leads to the real killer.

Kristeva uses the classic thriller genre to animate the themes that run through her work as a linguist and philosopher.

While Stephanie Delacour probes a brilliant gallery of suspects, we read between the lines some of the sorrows and dilemmas that are the focus of Kristeva's own life and work: motherhood and the complex relationship between mother and child; art and music; psychoanalysis; mourning and melancholia; language; the powers of horror; and the hostility aroused by a competent, gifted, and attractive woman who is at once devotedly maternal and capable of sexual passion.","['Fiction', 'Murder', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, women sleuths', 'Delacour, stephanie (fictitious character), fiction', 'Journalists, fiction']",['Eastern Europe'],,,,['OL31606A'],9,this sequel to julia kristevas celebrated allegory the old man and the wolves returns to the corrupt seaside resort of a mythical town where the boundaries between east and west civilization and barbarism and good and evil are erased part mystery part meditation this engrossing tale features the return of parisian amateur detective and newspaper reporter stephanie delacour kristevas alter ego drawn into the mystery of a friends murder the story opens with the gruesome discovery of the decapitated body of gifted translator gloria harrison delacour finds herself participating in the investigation in the company of detective superintendent northrup rilsky as the mystery unfolds delacour veers away from rilskys investigation on to a trail that leads to the real killer kristeva uses the classic thriller genre to animate the themes that run through her work as a linguist and philosopher while stephanie delacour probes a brilliant gallery of suspects we read between the lines some of the sorrows and dilemmas that are the focus of kristevas own life and work motherhood and the complex relationship between mother and child art and music psychoanalysis mourning and melancholia language the powers of horror and the hostility aroused by a competent gifted and attractive woman who is at once devotedly maternal and capable of sexual passion,6

Violent Screen,"In this book, his first as movie critic, Hunter does what no one else has done - identified the most important or notorious 100 movies released since 1982, organized them by topic, and analyzed them for how they uniquely deal with, and what they say about, violence.

Yet, as a serious book by a serious reviewer, it is timeless, too.

It's also entertaining. Hunter's movie-reviewing is rife with energy, humor, sharp-edged analysis, and intensity. He's a man who loves the movies so much he can't walk away from a reviewing job at a daily newspaper despite earning substantial sums on each of the novels he now writes.

The Bridge of Lost Desire,"The Bridge of Lost Desire (Return to Neveryon, Vol 4) (aka Return to Neveryon)
Of myth and literacy about a long-ago land on the brink of civilization.  In Neveryon, slavery is nonexistent, and three long tales explore the life of the legendary man, Gorgik the Liberator, responsible for freeing the empire's slaves. Seen through his own eyes--""The Game of Time and Pain"", Gorgik is a man still caught in his past.  To others, however, he is a shadow on the horizon of their lives--""The Tale of Rumor and Desire"", or else a collection of facts--""The Tale of Gorgik"" (novella 1979, a reprint from Vol 1)

Return to Neveryon is a series of eleven “sword and sorcery” stories--a science fiction/fantasy series depicting an empire beyond the borders of history where human destinies entwine in a strange design. It is an intricate web of adventure, intrigue and desire and a literary puzzle where meaning, parable and paradox collide.  The eleven tales that make up Return to Neveryon are set before the dawn of history, in a location that might be Africa or Asia.  Many of the stories have different protagonists and, indeed, different sets of foreground characters. But all take a greater or lesser part in recounting an overall story running through the whole series, the history of a man called Gorgik the Liberator.

Almost anything in pants has gone to serve Uncle Sam in the war--including Woody Mason, the head of a detective agency in midtown Manhattan. Left to run the show is his secretary, Faye Quick, who signed on to be a steno, not a shamus. At twenty-six and five foot four, there's not much to Faye, but she's got moxie--which she'll need when she stumbles over a dead girl in the street and takes on her first murder case.This victim wasn't any ordinary girl. Claudette West was a student at NYU and the daughter of a Park Avenue family. Faye, who lives in bohemian Greenwich Village--where no one cares how you look--ventures uptown, where people care enough about money to kill for it. Claudette's father is convinced greed was the motive, and that Claudette's working-class boyfriend, Richard Cotten, killed the girl because she threw him off the gravy train.Faye, however, isn't so sure, not when she learns about all the other men Claudette was secretly seeing--from her lecherous literature professor to an apparent con artist. For Faye, there are more shocking surprises in store than turns and dips in the Coney Island Cyclone.Going after the bad guys and fighting a good fight on the home front, Faye is as scrappy and endearing as any character Sandra Scoppettone has ever created, and This Dame for Hire's period setting is rendered so real you can hear the big band music, see the nylons and fedoras, and feel the rumble of the Third Avenue El.

The Final Detail,"His heart is broken. His partner is in jail. And someone is trying to kill him.
Then Myron Bolitar gets some really bad news....
For sports agent Myron Bolitar, it seemed like the perfect vacation. A tropical beach. A warm breeze. A little uncomplicated passion with a woman he barely knows. Myron is almost in heaven when his friend Win shows up with a message that blasts him back to reality: Esperanza is in trouble. It's time to come home.
Now Myron is back in New York, determined to help Esperanza, his best friend and partner, who's been accused of killing one of their clients. But Esperanza isn't talking. Neither is her lawyer. And to prove his friend's innocence, Myron must trace the rise and fall of the victim, a pitcher who had been making a comeback with the Yankees.

Seven Dials,"Millions of readers who love New York Times bestselling author Anne Perry and her novels cherish the magical passport she provides into the age of Victoria at its brilliant zenith. It was an unforgettable time when rich and powerful Englishmen contrived to make themselves even richer and more powerful. When Englishwomen were the glittering ornaments of an opulent society, rolling over cobblestones in their costly carriages, entertaining the chosen few in their elegant drawing rooms. Thoughts of the poor, rotting in London slums and in British dominions east and west of Suez, seldom troubled this prideful aristocracy. But a shocking murder was soon to remind them of their ever-present vulnerability.In the first gray of a mid-September morning, Thomas Pitt, mainstay of Her Majesty's Special Branch, is summoned to Connaught Square mansion where the body of a junior diplomat lies huddled in a wheelbarrow. Nearby stands the tenant of the house, the beautiful and notorious Egyptian woman Ayesha Zakhari, who falls under the shadow of suspicion. Pitt's orders, emanating from Prime Minister Gladstone himself, are to protect--at all costs--the good name of the third person in the garden: senior cabinet minister Saville Ryerson. This distinguished public servant, whispered to be Ayesha's lover, insists that she is as innocent as he is himself. Could it be true?In the dead man's less-than-stellar reputation, Pitt finds hope. But in ancient Alexandria, where the victim was once an army officer, hope grows dim. For there, Pitt receives intimations of deadly entanglements stretching from Egyptian cotton fields to Manchester cotton mills, from the noxious London slum known as Seven Dials to the madhouse called Bedlam.Meanwhile, in a packed courtroom at the Old Bailey, time is ticking away for Ayesha and Saville. With Pitt and his clients racing against the hangman, the trial reaches its pulse-pumping climax.","['Mystery', 'Detective and mystery stories', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Charlotte Pitt (Fictitious character)', 'Women detectives', 'Fiction', 'Thomas Pitt (Fictitious character)', 'Police spouses', 'Suspense', 'Police', 'Historical fiction', 'Large type books', 'London (england), fiction', 'Pitt, charlotte (fictitious character), fiction', 'Pitt, thomas (fictitious character), fiction', 'Fiction, historical, general', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, general', 'Policewomen, fiction', 'Fiction, mystery & detective, women sleuths']","['Alexandria', 'Egypt', 'England', 'London']","['Charlotte Pitt (Fictitious character)', 'Thomas Pitt (Fictitious character)']",['Victorian era'],,['OL25148A'],16,millions of readers who love new york times bestselling author anne perry and her novels cherish the magical passport she provides into the age of victoria at its brilliant zenith it was an unforgettable time when rich and powerful englishmen contrived to make themselves even richer and more powerful when englishwomen were the glittering ornaments of an opulent society rolling over cobblestones in their costly carriages entertaining the chosen few in their elegant drawing rooms thoughts of the poor rotting in london slums and in british dominions east and west of suez seldom troubled this prideful aristocracy but a shocking murder was soon to remind them of their everpresent vulnerabilityin the first gray of a midseptember morning thomas pitt mainstay of her majestys special branch is summoned to connaught square mansion where the body of a junior diplomat lies huddled in a wheelbarrow nearby stands the tenant of the house the beautiful and notorious egyptian woman ayesha zakhari who falls under the shadow of suspicion pitts orders emanating from prime minister gladstone himself are to protectat all coststhe good name of the third person in the garden senior cabinet minister saville ryerson this distinguished public servant whispered to be ayeshas lover insists that she is as innocent as he is himself could it be truein the dead mans lessthanstellar reputation pitt finds hope but in ancient alexandria where the victim was once an army officer hope grows dim for there pitt receives intimations of deadly entanglements stretching from egyptian cotton fields to manchester cotton mills from the noxious london slum known as seven dials to the madhouse called bedlammeanwhile in a packed courtroom at the old bailey time is ticking away for ayesha and saville with pitt and his clients racing against the hangman the trial reaches its pulsepumping climax,6

Back to the Bedroom,"Dear Reader:In a previous life, before the time of Plum, I wrote twelve short romance novels. Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Back to the Bedroom is presented here in almost original form. I've done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time around.I lived in northern Virginia when I wrote Back to the Bedroom. My children were young, and we spent a lot of time visiting the Washington, D.C. museums and wandering through the historic neighborhoods. One day while strolling Capitol Hill I came upon two townhouses that captured my imagination. The houses were totally different -- a birthday cake of a house and a bran muffin of a house, and yet they shared a common wall. I wondered about the people who lived inside the houses. And eventually the houses inspired Back to the Bedroom.Back to the Bedroom is the story of a young woman with the soul of a birthday cake living in a bran muffin house -- and a nice-looking guy with the substance of a bran muffin living in a birthday cake. They share some misadventures, some romantic moments, some misunderstandings, and ultimately they turn into wedding cake.And for Plum fans, you'll be interested to find that this was the first of the four romances to feature Elsie Hawkins, the prototype for Grandma Mazur.Janet Evanovich","['Women musicians', 'Fiction', 'Fiction, romance, general', 'Musicians, fiction', 'Large type books']",,,,,['OL21225A'],12,dear readerin a previous life before the time of plum i wrote twelve short romance novels redhot screwball comedies each and every one of them nine of these stories were originally published by the loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992 all immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard salesim excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being rereleased by harpercollins back to the bedroom is presented here in almost original form ive done only minor editing to correct some embarrassing bloopers missed the first time aroundi lived in northern virginia when i wrote back to the bedroom my children were young and we spent a lot of time visiting the washington dc museums and wandering through the historic neighborhoods one day while strolling capitol hill i came upon two townhouses that captured my imagination the houses were totally different a birthday cake of a house and a bran muffin of a house and yet they shared a common wall i wondered about the people who lived inside the houses and eventually the houses inspired back to the bedroomback to the bedroom is the story of a young woman with the soul of a birthday cake living in a bran muffin house and a nicelooking guy with the substance of a bran muffin living in a birthday cake they share some misadventures some romantic moments some misunderstandings and ultimately they turn into wedding cakeand for plum fans youll be interested to find that this was the first of the four romances to feature elsie hawkins the prototype for grandma mazurjanet evanovich,7

Sixty Days and Counting,"By the time Phil Chase is elected president, the world's climate is far on its way to irreversible change. Food scarcity, housing shortages, diminishing medical care, and vanishing species are just some of the consequences. The erratic winter the Washington, D.C., area is experiencing is another grim reminder of a global weather pattern gone haywire: bone-chilling cold one day, balmy weather the next.But the president-elect remains optimistic and doesn't intend to give up without a fight. A maverick in every sense of the word, Chase starts organizing the most ambitious plan to save the world from disaster since FDR--and assembling a team of top scientists and advisers to implement it.For Charlie Quibler, this means reentering the political fray full-time and giving up full-time care of his young son, Joe. For Frank Vanderwal, hampered by a brain injury, it means trying to protect the woman he loves from a vengeful ex and a rogue ""black ops"" agency not even the president can control--a task for which neither Frank's work at the National Science Foundation nor his study of Tibetan Buddhism can prepare him. In a world where time is running out as quickly as its natural resources, where surveillance is almost total and freedom nearly nonexistent, the forecast for the Chase administration looks darker each passing day. For as the last--and most terrible--of natural disasters looms on the horizon, it will take a miracle to stop the clock . . . the kind of miracle that only dedicated men and women can bring about.From the Hardcover edition.","['Science Fiction', 'Fiction', 'Climatic changes', 'Legislators', 'Scientists', 'Presidents', 'Global warming', 'Emergency management', 'Fiction, science fiction, general', 'Fiction, thrillers, suspense', 'Washington (d.c.), fiction']","['Washington DC', 'San Diego']","['Phil Chase', 'Frank Vanderwal', 'Drepung']",,,"['OL19986A', 'OL8077713A', 'OL3128270A']",11,by the time phil chase is elected president the worlds climate is far on its way to irreversible change food scarcity housing shortages diminishing medical care and vanishing species are just some of the consequences the erratic winter the washington dc area is experiencing is another grim reminder of a global weather pattern gone haywire bonechilling cold one day balmy weather the nextbut the presidentelect remains optimistic and doesnt intend to give up without a fight a maverick in every sense of the word chase starts organizing the most ambitious plan to save the world from disaster since fdrand assembling a team of top scientists and advisers to implement itfor charlie quibler this means reentering the political fray fulltime and giving up fulltime care of his young son joe for frank vanderwal hampered by a brain injury it means trying to protect the woman he loves from a vengeful ex and a rogue black ops agency not even the president can controla task for which neither franks work at the national science foundation nor his study of tibetan buddhism can prepare him in a world where time is running out as quickly as its natural resources where surveillance is almost total and freedom nearly nonexistent the forecast for the chase administration looks darker each passing day for as the lastand most terribleof natural disasters looms on the horizon it will take a miracle to stop the clock the kind of miracle that only dedicated men and women can bring aboutfrom the hardcover edition,3

Lammas Night,"The New York Times–bestselling author explores the occult history of WWII in this thriller inspired by true events during the Battle of Britain.

The year is 1940, and Great Britain’s forces struggle against the invincible Nazi war machine. France has fallen easily to Adolf Hitler’s army and England is next in his sights. A British secret agent pays the ultimate price to deliver early warning of the Führer’s secret plan to harness the awesome power of the occult to conquer Great Britain by launching a supernatural assault that no defending military force could possibly deflect.

British Intelligence operative Col. John “Gray” Graham of MI6 is not only a valuable player in the great game of wartime espionage, he is also a practitioner of the ancient occult arts. In this life—and other lives before—Gray’s destiny has been firmly intertwined with that of his close friend Prince William of the British royal family.

Now, with the future of Britain at stake, these two men, the spy and the royal, must rally the hidden adherents of the Old Religion, hoping to unite the British covens in defense of their endangered island homeland. But it will take more than combined Wiccan sorcery to repel the Reich’s black magic on Lammas Night—and the sacrifice required might be greater than imagined and truly terrible to endure.

Kinship in the Admiralty Islands,"""The Manus of New Guinea's Pere village were Margaret Mead's most favored community, the people to whom she returned five times before she died in 1978. Kinship in the Admiralty Islands is the classic and only thorough description of their complex rules of marriage and family relations. It draws on Mead's 1928-1929 field work, conducted with her second husband, New Zealander Reo Fortune, and benefits by her being able to cross-check her data with his.

Written in 1931, Kinship followed Mead's first and very popular book on the Manus, Growing Up in New Guinea, which was criticized by other anthropologists for being too general in scope. In Kinship, Mead succeeded in demonstrating her thorough knowledge of this Melanesian group in the specific terms prized by her scholarly colleagues, while also describing in depth Manus social structure."".

""Kinship in the Admiralty Islands describes an intricate system of social restraints and kinship ties and their impact on the local economy. The Manus' predilection for adoption for example, allows surrogate fathers to make extended marriage payments, while in the next generation their adopted sons will take on the same responsibility for other young men in the new kin network.

Mead reviews other kinship rules, such as avoidance behavior between in-laws of the opposite sex, early betrothals, other forms of adoption, and a range of deference behavior and joking relations among kin. In this work, Mead walks a fine line between functionalist kinship analysis of the British school of Radclife-Brown and the cultural-and-personality orientation of Americans in the school of Franz Boas.""--BOOK JACKET.","['Ethnology', 'Kinship', 'Manus (Papua New Guinea people)', 'Manus (Papua New Guinean people)', 'Social life and customs', 'Admiralty islands (alaska)', 'Papua new guinea, social life and customs']","['Admiralty Islands', 'Admiralty Islands (Papua New Guinea)', 'Kinship', 'Papua New Guinea']",,,,['OL21632A'],10,the manus of new guineas pere village were margaret meads most favored community the people to whom she returned five times before she died in 1978 kinship in the admiralty islands is the classic and only thorough description of their complex rules of marriage and family relations it draws on meads 19281929 field work conducted with her second husband new zealander reo fortune and benefits by her being able to crosscheck her data with his written in 1931 kinship followed meads first and very popular book on the manus growing up in new guinea which was criticized by other anthropologists for being too general in scope in kinship mead succeeded in demonstrating her thorough knowledge of this melanesian group in the specific terms prized by her scholarly colleagues while also describing in depth manus social structure kinship in the admiralty islands describes an intricate system of social restraints and kinship ties and their impact on the local economy the manus predilection for adoption for example allows surrogate fathers to make extended marriage payments while in the next generation their adopted sons will take on the same responsibility for other young men in the new kin network mead reviews other kinship rules such as avoidance behavior between inlaws of the opposite sex early betrothals other forms of adoption and a range of deference behavior and joking relations among kin in this work mead walks a fine line between functionalist kinship analysis of the british school of radclifebrown and the culturalandpersonality orientation of americans in the school of franz boasbook jacket,4

The re-creation of Brian Kent,"In 1919 Wright used the Ozarks again for his ninth novel, The Re-Creation of Brian Kent. Unfortunately, the novel does not maintain the quality which can be found in the earlier novel. In The Shepherd of the Hills, the landscape descriptions are realistic, depicting both the beauty of the spring season and the brutality of a drought. In contrast, Wright dwells upon trite sunsets in his later novel. The novel focuses on Brian Kent, a bank clerk who steals money from the Chicago bank where he works to placate his extravagant wife who socializes with members of a degenerate, rich clique. When he discovers her infidelity, he attempts suicide by drowning but is saved by Auntie Sue, an elderly woman who lives in the Ozarks. She is modeled after Wright's real Auntie Sue. With the assistance of her companion, Judy Taylor, a crippled girl abused by her alcoholic father, she helps Brian to return to his former good character before his wife's influence affected him. After the school teacher rehabilitates the former thief through hard work, he stays to help her. They discuss river philosophy and she suggests that he write a book. He agrees after he explains that he failed when he tried to write before. This time he succeeds because he has learned the meaning of life with Auntie Sue's help. To prepare the manuscript for the publisher, Betty Jo, a friend of Auntie Sue's, comes to serve as a typist. Brian and his typist fall in love, but a barrier stands between them -- Brian's wife. Also, Judy Taylor declares her love for Brian and unsuccessfully attempts to kill Betty Jo. A group of tourists, which includes his wife, discovers Brian. She has become a totally dissipated woman as a result of her reckless, but wealthy life with her lover. Fortunately, the wife drowns in the river in an opportune accident though Brian attempts to save her, an action which demonstrates the height of his moral character, since her death would free him to marry Betty Jo. Brian and Betty Jo marry upon the arrival of her uncle and guardian, the bank president from whom Brian stole the money. Not recognizing the ""recreated"" Brian, the uncle lauds him as the new genius whose book is so sensible. Glad to find him so much changed, Betty Jo's guardian grants his consent for the marriage, and the entire group is happy, including Judy, who realizes that she can never have Brian. She will try to become a better human being by following the example set by Brian and Auntie Sue. - Dr. Joyce Kinkead.",,,,,,['OL2827605A'],5,in 1919 wright used the ozarks again for his ninth novel the recreation of brian kent unfortunately the novel does not maintain the quality which can be found in the earlier novel in the shepherd of the hills the landscape descriptions are realistic depicting both the beauty of the spring season and the brutality of a drought in contrast wright dwells upon trite sunsets in his later novel the novel focuses on brian kent a bank clerk who steals money from the chicago bank where he works to placate his extravagant wife who socializes with members of a degenerate rich clique when he discovers her infidelity he attempts suicide by drowning but is saved by auntie sue an elderly woman who lives in the ozarks she is modeled after wrights real auntie sue with the assistance of her companion judy taylor a crippled girl abused by her alcoholic father she helps brian to return to his former good character before his wifes influence affected him after the school teacher rehabilitates the former thief through hard work he stays to help her they discuss river philosophy and she suggests that he write a book he agrees after he explains that he failed when he tried to write before this time he succeeds because he has learned the meaning of life with auntie sues help to prepare the manuscript for the publisher betty jo a friend of auntie sues comes to serve as a typist brian and his typist fall in love but a barrier stands between them brians wife also judy taylor declares her love for brian and unsuccessfully attempts to kill betty jo a group of tourists which includes his wife discovers brian she has become a totally dissipated woman as a result of her reckless but wealthy life with her lover fortunately the wife drowns in the river in an opportune accident though brian attempts to save her an action which demonstrates the height of his moral character since her death would free him to marry betty jo brian and betty jo marry upon the arrival of her uncle and guardian the bank president from whom brian stole the money not recognizing the recreated brian the uncle lauds him as the new genius whose book is so sensible glad to find him so much changed betty jos guardian grants his consent for the marriage and the entire group is happy including judy who realizes that she can never have brian she will try to become a better human being by following the example set by brian and auntie sue dr joyce kinkead,7

The story of our future begins with the history of Foundation and its greatest psychohistorian: Hari Seldon.  For twelve thousand years the Galactic Empire has ruled supreme. Now it is dying.  Only Hari Seldon, creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory, can see into the future--a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that will last thirty thousand years. To preserve knowledge and save mankind, Seldon gathers the best minds in the Empire--both scientists and scholars--and brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the Galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations. He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.

And mankind's last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice: submit to the barbarians and live as slaves--or take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction.","['Psychohistory', 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'Life on other planets', 'Fiction', 'Science Fiction', 'Long Now Manual for Civilization', 'Prophecy', 'Historians', 'Robots', 'Fiction, science fiction, general', 'American literature', 'American Fantasy fiction', 'Vie extraterrestre', 'Romans, nouvelles', 'Psychohistoire', 'Psychological fiction', 'American Science fiction', 'Hari Seldon (Fictitious character)']",,"['Hari Seldon (Fictitious character)', 'Hober Mallow (Fictitious character)', 'Salvor Hardin (Fictitious character)']",,,['OL34221A'],52,one of the great masterworks of science fiction the foundation novels of isaac asimov are unsurpassed for their unique blend of nonstop action daring ideas and extensive worldbuilding the story of our future begins with the history of foundation and its greatest psychohistorian hari seldon for twelve thousand years the galactic empire has ruled supreme now it is dying only hari seldon creator of the revolutionary science of psychohistory can see into the futurea dark age of ignorance barbarism and warfare that will last thirty thousand years to preserve knowledge and save mankind seldon gathers the best minds in the empireboth scientists and scholarsand brings them to a bleak planet at the edge of the galaxy to serve as a beacon of hope for future generations he calls his sanctuary the foundation but soon the fledgling foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding empire and mankinds last best hope is faced with an agonizing choice submit to the barbarians and live as slavesor take a stand for freedom and risk total destruction,4
Final Approach,"An airliner attempting a bad-weather landing in a Midwest city plows into another awaiting takeoff. With more than 100 people dead, the National Transportation Safety Board assigns Joe Wallingford to investigate. Was the disaster caused by human error or by technical malfunction? Did outside electronic interference, perhaps from a top-secret SDI radar, disrupt flight controls? Nance, a leading airline safety analyst and author of nonfiction works on aviation, debuts as a novelist with a first-rate technical detective story. While keeping readers in suspense, he explores the dynamics of factions within the safety bureaucracy and limns the problems raised for airline management by deregulation.

Elie Wiesel's secretive texts,"Elie Wiesel's fiction is rooted in his experience as a survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald. His work as a novelist has been accompanied by increasing involvement in human rights activities, for which he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.

Working through some of the ethical implications of literary interpretation, Colin Davis examines the consequences of taking a modern critical perspective on Holocaust literature. With the notion of narrative secrecy fundamental to his study, he suggests that Wiesel's fiction is more darkly ambiguous and deeply complex than his stance on human rights issues.

Drawing on Wiesel's short stories, novels, and essays, Davis illustrates the disjunction between the uncertainties expressed in Wiesel's fiction and the polemical confidence of some of his nonliterary writing. He discusses tensions in the fiction in the context of the personal, theological, intellectual, and aesthetic traumas of the Holocaust.

He analyzes important themes in Wiesel's writing, such as madness, language and silence, and the death of the father, and links them in an original manner to the ideas of storytelling and of the loss of meaning. He ends the book by drawing some tentative conclusions about secrecy and interpretation through a consideration of Wiesel's most recent novel, The Forgotten.

. Davis acknowledges the risks involved in approaching Holocaust literature from the standpoint of fictional form. He writes, ""By concentrating on hesitations and indeterminacies in Wiesel's writing, I do not for a moment intend to deny the awful reality of the Holocaust, or to detract from Wiesel's remarkable work as a human rights activist."" While Wiesel's fiction is disturbingly enigmatic, Davis says, the pain on every page is radiantly clear.","['Criticism and interpretation', 'American', 'LITERARY CRITICISM', 'General', 'Wiesel, elie, 1928-2016', 'American fiction, history and criticism, 20th century']",,['Elie Wiesel (1928-)'],,,['OL25127A'],6,elie wiesels fiction is rooted in his experience as a survivor of auschwitz and buchenwald his work as a novelist has been accompanied by increasing involvement in human rights activities for which he received the nobel peace prize in 1986 working through some of the ethical implications of literary interpretation colin davis examines the consequences of taking a modern critical perspective on holocaust literature with the notion of narrative secrecy fundamental to his study he suggests that wiesels fiction is more darkly ambiguous and deeply complex than his stance on human rights issues drawing on wiesels short stories novels and essays davis illustrates the disjunction between the uncertainties expressed in wiesels fiction and the polemical confidence of some of his nonliterary writing he discusses tensions in the fiction in the context of the personal theological intellectual and aesthetic traumas of the holocaust he analyzes important themes in wiesels writing such as madness language and silence and the death of the father and links them in an original manner to the ideas of storytelling and of the loss of meaning he ends the book by drawing some tentative conclusions about secrecy and interpretation through a consideration of wiesels most recent novel the forgotten davis acknowledges the risks involved in approaching holocaust literature from the standpoint of fictional form he writes by concentrating on hesitations and indeterminacies in wiesels writing i do not for a moment intend to deny the awful reality of the holocaust or to detract from wiesels remarkable work as a human rights activist while wiesels fiction is disturbingly enigmatic davis says the pain on every page is radiantly clear,4

The White Raven,"This haunting retelling of the tale of Tristan and Iseult (here called Drustan and Esseilte in accordance with Celtic legend and language) goes back to early versions, before Mallory and Wagner, to explore the nature of love, duty and loyalty. The story is told by Branwen, cousin and companion to Esseilte, daughter of the High King of Eriu (Ireland).

The two young women save the life of a badly wounded harper, later discovered to be Drustan, who had killed Esseilte's beloved uncle and Branwen's father, Morholt, in battle. Drustan seeks Esseilte's hand for his uncle, Marc'h, King of Kernow (Cornwall), an alliance arranged for political reasons.

On the way to Cornwall, Esseilte tries to poison Drustan, but the potion they both drink turns out to be a love filtre prepared for Esseilte and Marc'h. Thus the tale is set in motion, with passion and hate binding the lovers together. With Branwen's aid, they are able to deceive Marc'h on the wedding night: Branwen, close in appearance to the queen, sleeps with the king and falls in love with him. For a while Esseilte and Drustan escape detection, but eventually they are caught in circumstances that cannot be ignored, leading to the tragic denouement.

From Union Square to Rome,"Here is an early work of Dorothy Day, who tells the story of her conversion from Communist journalist to Catholic Worker. Much of what she wrote here in 1938 would be taken up in her book ""Loaves and Fishes"", written more than a decade later. This first recounting of her faith journey, however, has a freshness and immediacy that the later work does not share. Part of this is because she write largely in the ""second person"" -- that is, she addresses her book to her brother, making an account of her heart and her life to this younger sibling with whom she shared so many ideals but not the Christian faith. Of course, this is part of the genre. 

Dorothy Day published her reflections to her brother in book form, so I take this to mean that she wanted to direct her message it for many other brothers and sisters, unbelievers and believers.

"Edgar Snow, a biography","""Snow's classic Red Star Over China was a journalistic coup. Based on interviews with Mao Zedong and his followers, who were in hiding, cut off from Western observers for a decade, his bestseller revealed that Chinese Communism was a cohesive popular movement, not a ragtag army of bandits. But Snow (1905-1972), the adventurous reporter from Kansas City, Missouri, and stowaway to the Far East, told Americans things they did not want to hear. The Cold War public ignored his measured portrayal of a protectionist Soviet Union crippled by WW II and not bent on spreading communism. During the McCarthy witch-hunt period, this romantic idealist, who once called Mao an agrarian democrat, was blamed for misleading Americans. Even as Snow's political opinions matured, his message that China wanted closer ties with the U.S. went unheeded. Written by a journalist who worked in the U.S. Agency for International Development, this serviceable biography is as plainspoken as its down-to-earth subject. The early chapters on Snow's incredible adventures across Asia are the best.

The films of Charlie Chaplin,"Hacia el año 1914, un desconocido comediante de veinticinco años, llamado Charles Spencer Chaplin, entraba en el cine de la mano de los Estudios  Keystone.  En aquel  momento, el que más tarde merecería el nombre de «séptimo arte», era apenas un balbuceo, que no obtenía la atención de las personas «inteligentes». Comedias de un solo rollo: grotescos melodramas de una ingenuidad infantil, episodios de un dinamismo frenético que desembocaban inevitablemente en  persecuciones de  hombres-títere enloquecidos. Charlot entró en ese juego,   que   contenía   un   importante porcentaje de espectáculo circense, y muy  pronto  nuestro hombre, con genial intuición, fijó su forma de expresarse y su  indumentaria.

Han pasado más de sesenta años —toda una época— y Chaplin ha crecido y se ha enriquecido con la evolución del  cine,  pero  sin  desmentirse  jamás. Su prodigioso, innato y sin par poder de invención, su tremenda vocación artística, arraigada en el conocimiento emocionado del hombre y de sus desventuras, moldeadas por la piedad o deformadas por un infalible y original sentido del humor, de validez universal, han dado al cine —y al mundo— una imagen —a menudo una parodia— de la vida sólo comparable a las más grandes creaciones de la literatura de todos los tiempos.

Summer of Fire,"Summer of Fire
Patricia Lauber
Summary
Setting: Summer of 1988 in Yellowstone National Park
In the summer of 1988, there were many fires in Yellowstone National Park. At first,
the fires were allowed to burn. Park rangers expected that the summer would be
rainy as usual. The rain would dampen small fires. But the summer stayed dry and
the fires were growing. Many fire fighters were brought in to try to stop the fires but
they were unable to put them out. They could only try to save the important buildings
in the park. Most of the fires died out when rain and snow started to fall in
September. In the end, only one third of the park was damaged. In the burned areas,
there was new growth. This growth led to an increase in the number of birds,
animals, and other plants.","['Ecology', 'Fire ecology', 'Forest fires', 'Forest ecology', 'National parks and reserves', 'Juvenile literature', 'Yellowstone national park, juvenile literature', 'Yellowstone national park', 'Forests and forestry']",['Yellowstone National Park'],,['Summer of 1988'],,['OL31850A'],8,summer of fire patricia lauber summary setting summer of 1988 in yellowstone national park in the summer of 1988 there were many fires in yellowstone national park at first the fires were allowed to burn park rangers expected that the summer would be rainy as usual the rain would dampen small fires but the summer stayed dry and the fires were growing many fire fighters were brought in to try to stop the fires but they were unable to put them out they could only try to save the important buildings in the park most of the fires died out when rain and snow started to fall in september in the end only one third of the park was damaged in the burned areas there was new growth this growth led to an increase in the number of birds animals and other plants,14
The Trespasser,"D.H. Lawrence's second novel The Trespasser is based on the tragic love affair of his friend Helen Corke and her violin teacher. After reading Miss Corke's diary, Lawrence first urged her to write her story and then received her permission to do it himself. Between his rapid composition of the first draft in the spring and summer of 1910 and his final revisions in early 1912, Lawrence's view of Helen Corke, and consequently of her story, changed. The manuscript survives, and this edition presents the text for the first time as Lawrence wrote it, restoring his sentence-structure and punctuation and correcting numerous typesetters' errors. In her substantial introduction Elizabeth Mansfield explores the background of the novel, presents the complications of the publishing history and the novel's reception.

Hot target,"New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann knows exactly what makes hearts race and pulses pound: peril and passion. No one succeeds more brilliantly at blending these exhilarating elements in breathtaking novels of men and women forced to grapple with the deepest emotions and the highest risks. And there's no better proof than her new novel of suspense: Hot Target aims to thrill on every level. Like most men of action, Navy SEAL Chief Cosmo Richter never learned how to take a vacation. So when he finds himself facing a month's leave, he offers his services to Troubleshooters Incorporated. Founded by a former SEAL, the private-sector security firm is a major player in the ongoing war against terrorism, known for carrying out covert missions too volatile for official U.S. military action. But the first case Richter takes on is anything but under the radar.High-profile maverick movie producer Jane Mercedes Chadwick hasn't quite completed her newest film, but she's already courting controversy. The World War II epic frankly portrays the homosexuality of a real-life hero--and the storm of advance media buzz surrounding it has drawn the fury of extremist groups. But despite a relentless campaign of angry E-mails, phone calls, and smear tactics, Chadwick won't be pressured into abandoning the project. Then the harassment turns to death threats.While the FBI appears on the scene, nervous Hollywood associates call in Troubleshooters, and now Chadwick has an army of round-the-clock bodyguards, whether she likes it or not. And she definitely doesn't. But her stubbornness doesn't make FBI agent Jules Cassidy's job any easier. The fiercely independent filmmaker presents yet another emotional obstacle that Cassidy doesn't need--he's already in the midst of a personal tug-of-war with his ex-lover, while fighting a growing attraction to Chadwick's brother.Determined to succeed--and survive--on her own terms, Chadwick will face off with enemies and allies alike. But she doesn't count on the bond she forms with the quiet, capable Cosmo Richter. Yet even as their feelings bring them closer, the noose of deadly terror all around them draws tighter. And when all hell erupts, desire and desperate choices will collide on a killing ground that may trap them both in the crossfire.From the Hardcover edition.","['Fiction', 'Right-wing extremists', 'Bodyguards', 'Women motion picture producers and directors', 'Suspense fiction', 'Romance', 'Motion picture producers and directors', 'Large type books']",,,,,['OL40094A'],11,new york times bestselling author suzanne brockmann knows exactly what makes hearts race and pulses pound peril and passion no one succeeds more brilliantly at blending these exhilarating elements in breathtaking novels of men and women forced to grapple with the deepest emotions and the highest risks and theres no better proof than her new novel of suspense hot target aims to thrill on every level like most men of action navy seal chief cosmo richter never learned how to take a vacation so when he finds himself facing a months leave he offers his services to troubleshooters incorporated founded by a former seal the privatesector security firm is a major player in the ongoing war against terrorism known for carrying out covert missions too volatile for official us military action but the first case richter takes on is anything but under the radarhighprofile maverick movie producer jane mercedes chadwick hasnt quite completed her newest film but shes already courting controversy the world war ii epic frankly portrays the homosexuality of a reallife heroand the storm of advance media buzz surrounding it has drawn the fury of extremist groups but despite a relentless campaign of angry emails phone calls and smear tactics chadwick wont be pressured into abandoning the project then the harassment turns to death threatswhile the fbi appears on the scene nervous hollywood associates call in troubleshooters and now chadwick has an army of roundtheclock bodyguards whether she likes it or not and she definitely doesnt but her stubbornness doesnt make fbi agent jules cassidys job any easier the fiercely independent filmmaker presents yet another emotional obstacle that cassidy doesnt needhes already in the midst of a personal tugofwar with his exlover while fighting a growing attraction to chadwicks brotherdetermined to succeedand surviveon her own terms chadwick will face off with enemies and allies alike but she doesnt count on the bond she forms with the quiet capable cosmo richter yet even as their feelings bring them closer the noose of deadly terror all around them draws tighter and when all hell erupts desire and desperate choices will collide on a killing ground that may trap them both in the crossfirefrom the hardcover edition,6

Bottom,"""Written between 1947 and 1960 and first published in 1963, the prose work in the first of these two volumes reflects Louis Zukofsky's ongoing obsession with Shakespeare - whose plays he had first seen performed in Yiddish - and is central to understanding Zukofsky's work. Tracing the themes of knowledge, love and physical vision (""the eyes have it"") through both Shakespeare's plays and the poetry, Bottom: On Shakespeare is more than a compendious act of homage by one poet to another.

In effect, it lays out Zukofsky's poetics and theory of knowledge on a grand scale, tracing his themes through the whole of Western culture, from the Classical Greeks through William Carlos Williams."".

The Memory of Earth,"The planet called Harmony had been settled by humans nearly forty million years before. The colony had been placed under the care of an artificial intelligence, called the Oversoul, high in orbit. This master computer had one overriding command: Guard the people of Harmony against the dangers that destroyed humankind on Earth and other worlds. But now the Oversoul was itself in danger. Its systems were failing. Soon, within a thousand years, catastrophic war would break out on Harmony unless the Oversoul could be repaired.

The Oversoul determined that its core must be taken back to lost Earth, to interface with the Master Computer there, to be repaired and reprogrammed. But in order to do that, someone on Harmony must be given back the knowledge of space travel. And so the Oversoul must interfere directly with individuals on Harmony, in order to save the planet from disaster.

And so, on the planet, while on the road to the city called Basilica, a man named Wetchik had a vision of destruction, sent by the Oversoul. Soon his sons, Elemak, Issib, Mebbekew and Nafai were drawn into conflict-with the city and with each other-as the Oversoul began destabilizing forty million years of social engineering. But even a master computer worshipped as a god can't guarantee that knowledge will be used only as it is intended.

A Regular Guy,"Tom Owens had dropped out of college to invent, right in his parents' basement, a new kind of business; it was no time to suffer any distractions, much less to legitimize the family he in fact had already started on his own. So he stayed on in the sleepy, Edenic valley town of his youth, and it was here that Owens became famously successful, his charisma and peerless business acumen also creating a seductive, if aimless, political persona.

Then, suddenly, a raggedy grade-schooler turns up smack in the middle of his hectic life, claiming to be his daughter. Born in an Oregon commune, Jane has led an itinerant life with her mother, Mary, and only a vague notion of her father - a rich man, she was told. Now, years later, she finds herself becoming another of his complex relationships. There's the dependent yet unsettled Mary, with whom he eventually shares custody.

And Olivia, his beautiful long-standing girlfriend, not to mention her rivals for his fleeting affection. There's Noah Kaskie, his best friend and intellectual alter ego, who craves what Owens takes for granted, ignores, sometimes flees. And, finally, the company that made his reputation is now subject to the very market forces Owens had exploited and refined.

Dancing on Tisha B'av,"**From Publishers Weekly:**

Tisha B'Av (the Ninth of the Hebrew month of Ab), which commemorates the destruction of both Jerusalem temples, is observed by fasting and public mourning. In the title story of Raphael's first collection, a gay student has been publicly humiliated in a university synagogue. Furious and frustrated, he lashes out at God and his own commitment to Judaism by dancing on the holiday. Raphael's characters, struggling to find identities as Jews, gays or children of Holocaust survivors, are angry, humorless and largely self-absorbed. Although message dominates plot in most of the tales, when the author permits personalities and events to play themselves out, he creates a more natural and sympathetic setting for his themes. In ""War Stories,"" a remote, morose New York cab driver believes he is his family's sole survivor. When a cousin long thought dead enters his cab, he is transformed; he can finally break down and express his emotions. In ""Abominations, "" on the other hand, in which the characters in the title story are reencountered, Raphael errs into overemphasis: the torching of the gay student's dormitory room is compared by his sister to the Holocaust's conflagrations. Here as in other stories, Raphael forgets that people's lives can be interesting, instructive and important without the explicit ascription of cosmic significance.

**From Library Journal**:

The 19 short stories in this first collection give the reader a glimpse of what it's like to be gay and Jewish, probing the problems encountered when trying to reconcile seemingly incompatible sensibilities. The author draws interesting parallels between the treatment of Jews in Europe before and during the World War II; several stories include concentration camp survivors parenting gay children, with each generation painfully aware of the discrimination and suffering experienced by the other. The title story begins with a sister admiring her brother's devotion to Orthodoxy, while refusing to confront his homosexuality; it concludes with his expulsion from his religious minyan, the torching of his dorm room by bigots, and her new understanding and sensitivity to another potential holocaust. Recommended.

Encountering Macau,"Tracing the history of this tiny peninsula perched off the coast of China, Geoffrey Gunn skillfully charts five hundred years of colonial encounter and economic relations with China, Japan, and the Asia region.

Making use of historical photographs, illustrations, and archival records, Gunn situates Macau in its Asian context since the sixteenth century, arguing that Macau's history has been shaped by more than its economic incorporation into a Euro-centric world system - on Chinese terms - or its survival in the twentieth century as an essentially rentier state built around gambling.

The author considers the complex and ultimately doomed struggle by the Portuguese to assert sovereignty over Macau, which was reclaimed by China in the historic Sino-Portuguese Declaration of 1987, that foreshadows the end of Western rule in China. Macau's multifaceted and fascinating saga draws out wider lessons about the nature of colonialism in Asia and the shape of the East Asian world order in the coming Pacific century.","['Politics and government', 'Economic conditions', 'Macau (china : special administrative region), history']",['Macau (China : Special Administrative Region)'],,,,['OL34348A'],8,tracing the history of this tiny peninsula perched off the coast of china geoffrey gunn skillfully charts five hundred years of colonial encounter and economic relations with china japan and the asia region making use of historical photographs illustrations and archival records gunn situates macau in its asian context since the sixteenth century arguing that macaus history has been shaped by more than its economic incorporation into a eurocentric world system on chinese terms or its survival in the twentieth century as an essentially rentier state built around gambling the author considers the complex and ultimately doomed struggle by the portuguese to assert sovereignty over macau which was reclaimed by china in the historic sinoportuguese declaration of 1987 that foreshadows the end of western rule in china macaus multifaceted and fascinating saga draws out wider lessons about the nature of colonialism in asia and the shape of the east asian world order in the coming pacific century,3

No doubt, one can find more recent books online on the subject but this is a nice sample of ""byzantine"" historiography from late 19th century. Anyway, you can still get the basics.

True women,"True Women is a stunning first novel based on the author's own roots.

Brought up on her family's ""great epic tales of war and adventure, love and murder, violence and redemption,"" Janice Woods Windle searched for the sources that could tell her the truth about the extraordinary women whose blood flowed through her veins.

What she discovered was more dramatic still, and from those tales she has crafted a breathtaking work of historical fiction about two dynastic lines, the King and Woods families - the story of the true women of Seguin, and the giants whose destinies touched their lives.

Here, Euphemia Texas Ashby King stands firm against the Mexican general Santa Anna and the feared Comanche, Tarantula, and leads the bitter battle for women's suffrage; Georgia Virginia Lawshe Woods defends her household by any means necessary from the sexual blackmail of a corrupt Yankee commandant; and Bettie Moss King fends off wolves, storms, and the Ku Klux Klan as she steers her loved ones through the turbulent birth of modern times.

Deeply devoted to family, land, and the state of Texas, passionate and strong-willed, these are extraordinary characters who live, love, and die in a river of time reaching from the battle of the Alamo to World War II.

Interweaving the heroic naturalism of Edna Ferber with the magical realism of Texas legend and the real-life history of Sam Houston, Santa Anna, and other historical figures, Janice Woods Windle has transmuted her ancestral provenance into a remarkable work of literary invention and popular appeal.","['Women', 'Fiction', 'Families', 'Large type books', 'Texas, fiction', 'Fiction, historical, general']",['Texas'],,,,['OL39354A'],11,true women is a stunning first novel based on the authors own roots brought up on her familys great epic tales of war and adventure love and murder violence and redemption janice woods windle searched for the sources that could tell her the truth about the extraordinary women whose blood flowed through her veins what she discovered was more dramatic still and from those tales she has crafted a breathtaking work of historical fiction about two dynastic lines the king and woods families the story of the true women of seguin and the giants whose destinies touched their lives here euphemia texas ashby king stands firm against the mexican general santa anna and the feared comanche tarantula and leads the bitter battle for womens suffrage georgia virginia lawshe woods defends her household by any means necessary from the sexual blackmail of a corrupt yankee commandant and bettie moss king fends off wolves storms and the ku klux klan as she steers her loved ones through the turbulent birth of modern times deeply devoted to family land and the state of texas passionate and strongwilled these are extraordinary characters who live love and die in a river of time reaching from the battle of the alamo to world war ii interweaving the heroic naturalism of edna ferber with the magical realism of texas legend and the reallife history of sam houston santa anna and other historical figures janice woods windle has transmuted her ancestral provenance into a remarkable work of literary invention and popular appeal,3

Why, as Freud once asked, is a man willing to kiss a woman passionately, but not use her toothbrush? And how many times should you baptize a two-headed twin?

Jour où je n'étais pas là,"""The title of Christine Schutt's second collection strikes the theme of swiftly passing time that runs through each of the stories. In ""The Life of the Palm and the Breast"" a woman watches her half-grown children running through the house and wonders: Whose boys are these? Whose life is this? The title story tells of a grandfather who has lived long enough to see his daughter's struggles echoed in his granddaughter and how her unhappiness leads him to unexpectedly feel the weight of his years. In ""Darkest of All"" a mother's relationship with her sons is wreaked by a repeated cycle of drugs and abusive relationships, the years pass and the pain-and its chosen remedy-remains the same. The narrator in ""Winterreise"" evokes Thoreau and strives to be heroic in the face of her longtime friend's imminent death, a harsh reminder of the time that is allotted to each of us. Schutt's indomitable, original talent is once again on full display in each of these deeply informed, intensely realized stories. Many of the narratives take place in a space as small as a house, where the doors are many and what is hidden behind these thin domestic barriers tends towards violence, abusive sex, and mental anguish.

In Search of Snow,"Set in Arizona in the mid-1950s and alive with the unique racial mix of the American Southwest, In Search of Snow tells the story of Mike McGurk, a sort of blue-collar Don Quixote, whose search for love forms the backbone of this American picaresque novel.

Son of the redoubtable Texaco Turk McGurk - gas station operator, small-time boxer, and wandering misfit who lets loose foul-mouthed slurs about almost everyone and hews to an impossible, often hilarious, code of masculinity - Mike yearns for his mother, who died when he was seven, and for a sense of family and connection, which the emotionally bankrupt Turk, for all his bluster and redneck charm, cannot provide.

In his search for love and a life in the Arizona desert, where opportunities for both are limited, Mike makes a new friend in Bobo Garcia, a Mexican-American prize-fighter-turned-mechanic who is also a World War II veteran, albeit one who saw more of that war's horrors than Mike. Bobo rescues Mike from the clutches of Ramses Castro and his Indian gang and accompanies him on a journey that leads from one unlikely adventure to the next.

From the excitement of erotic love, which beckons in the person of Mike's college-bound cousin Lily, to the comfort and responsibility of familial love amid the sprawling Garcia clan, Mike struggles with the sometimes comic dilemma of manhood. Although he begins as the victim of circumstance, Mike finally takes charge of his own destiny through a cathartic act of destruction that lights up his beloved Arizona desert.

With a remarkable variety of idiosyncratic characters who are imagined in detail so telling that even their bedroom slippers speak volumes and with natural scenes so intimately rendered that you can hear the delicate sound of sand granules rustling along the tarmac in a light desert wind, In Search of Snow introduces an exciting new writer whose gift for fiction is as dazzling as his prose.","['Fiction', 'Veterans', 'Ethnic relations', 'World War, 1939-1945', 'Friendship', 'World War, 1939-1945 -- Veterans -- Fiction', 'Men', 'Fiction, general', 'Friendship, fiction', 'Arizona, fiction']",['Arizona'],,,,['OL28161A'],9,set in arizona in the mid1950s and alive with the unique racial mix of the american southwest in search of snow tells the story of mike mcgurk a sort of bluecollar don quixote whose search for love forms the backbone of this american picaresque novel son of the redoubtable texaco turk mcgurk gas station operator smalltime boxer and wandering misfit who lets loose foulmouthed slurs about almost everyone and hews to an impossible often hilarious code of masculinity mike yearns for his mother who died when he was seven and for a sense of family and connection which the emotionally bankrupt turk for all his bluster and redneck charm cannot provide in his search for love and a life in the arizona desert where opportunities for both are limited mike makes a new friend in bobo garcia a mexicanamerican prizefighterturnedmechanic who is also a world war ii veteran albeit one who saw more of that wars horrors than mike bobo rescues mike from the clutches of ramses castro and his indian gang and accompanies him on a journey that leads from one unlikely adventure to the next from the excitement of erotic love which beckons in the person of mikes collegebound cousin lily to the comfort and responsibility of familial love amid the sprawling garcia clan mike struggles with the sometimes comic dilemma of manhood although he begins as the victim of circumstance mike finally takes charge of his own destiny through a cathartic act of destruction that lights up his beloved arizona desert with a remarkable variety of idiosyncratic characters who are imagined in detail so telling that even their bedroom slippers speak volumes and with natural scenes so intimately rendered that you can hear the delicate sound of sand granules rustling along the tarmac in a light desert wind in search of snow introduces an exciting new writer whose gift for fiction is as dazzling as his prose,7

Children of Kali,"""In the early 1800s, the greatest criminal gang in history operated throughout India. Its members were inspired by religious fanatics and came from many faiths, yet they worshipped one goddess, Kali.

Epigrammata,"The new edition of The Epigrams of Philodemos collects all the epigrams attributed to the Epicurean philosopher and poet Philodemos of Gadara (c.110-c.40 B.C.), and is the first to receive separate publication since the brief - and incomplete - Programmschrift of George Kaibel in 1885. The heart of this book consists of a newly edited text, the result of a reexamination of several manuscripts of the Greek Anthology.

Thirty-eight epigrams (two only doubtfully Philodemean, and two spurious) are printed in the original Greek and in English translation, with full critical apparatus and commentary. Sider also includes the text of a recently edited papyrus containing fragments of many previously known and newly discovered epigrams by Philodemos.

In addition to the usual issues involved in editing a classical poet - i.e. the poet's life, his use of meter, the epigrammatic tradition, and the place of the epigrams in the Greek Anthology - Sider's introduction considers the relationship between Philodemos' philosophy and poetry. He explains how the epigrams fit into the literary views expressed in Philodemos' On Poems and how they accord with the Epicurean stance against the writing of poetry.

This edition is far more comprehensive than any other text and commentary on Philodemos' epigrams, and is the only one to assess his poetry in the light of his poetic theory. It will be of great use to students of Greek and Latin poetry, where echoes of Philodemos are found in works of Vergil, Catullus, Horace, Ovid, Marital, and Propertius.","['Greek Epigrams', 'Translations into English', 'Translations into Italian', 'Epigrams']",,,,,['OL39559A'],7,the new edition of the epigrams of philodemos collects all the epigrams attributed to the epicurean philosopher and poet philodemos of gadara c110c40 bc and is the first to receive separate publication since the brief and incomplete programmschrift of george kaibel in 1885 the heart of this book consists of a newly edited text the result of a reexamination of several manuscripts of the greek anthology thirtyeight epigrams two only doubtfully philodemean and two spurious are printed in the original greek and in english translation with full critical apparatus and commentary sider also includes the text of a recently edited papyrus containing fragments of many previously known and newly discovered epigrams by philodemos in addition to the usual issues involved in editing a classical poet ie the poets life his use of meter the epigrammatic tradition and the place of the epigrams in the greek anthology siders introduction considers the relationship between philodemos philosophy and poetry he explains how the epigrams fit into the literary views expressed in philodemos on poems and how they accord with the epicurean stance against the writing of poetry this edition is far more comprehensive than any other text and commentary on philodemos epigrams and is the only one to assess his poetry in the light of his poetic theory it will be of great use to students of greek and latin poetry where echoes of philodemos are found in works of vergil catullus horace ovid marital and propertius,18

Hard eight,"Hard Up
Fugitive Apprehension Agent Stephanie Plum has a big problem on her hands: Seven-year-old Annie Soder and her mother, Evelyn, have disappeared. Evelyn's estranged husband, Steven, a shady owner of a seedy bar, is not at all happy. Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter. But Evelyn's grandmother lives next door to Stephanie's parents, so Stephanie follows the trail left by Annie and Evelyn-and finds a lot more than she bargained for.

Hard Risk
Steven Soder is somehow linked with a very scary Eddie Abruzzi. Trenton cop and on-again, off-again fiancé Joe Morelli and Stephanie's mentor and tormentor, Ranger, warn Stephanie about Abruzzi, but it's Abruzzi's eyes and mannerisms that frighten Stephanie most. Stephanie needs Ranger's savvy and expertise, and she's willing to accept his help to find Annie even though it might mean getting too involved with Ranger. Stephanie, Ranger, Lula (who's not going to miss riding with Ranger), and Evelyn's lawyer/Laundromat manager set out to find Annie. The search turns out to be a race among Stephanie's posse, the True Blue Bonds' agent-a Rangerette known as Jeanne Ellen Burrows-and the Abruzzi crew. Plus, there's a killer rabbit on the loose!

Running from safety,"Richard Bach made a promise, fifty years ago, to come back through time and teach himself everything he had learned from living. The pledge was forgotten until the day when, midair in his paraglider, Richard met Dickie Bach, age nine, who expected the promise to be kept.

In this intimate adventure of mind and heart, Richard sets out to show Dickie the things that matter, and finds his teaching doesn't go as planned. Here is a book spun from delight and disaster, and from surprising notions about old questions: Who are we? What do we want to do with our lives, and why aren't we doing it? Must we be the victim of circumstance instead of its master? How do we learn to love?

Throughout, Leslie Parrish-Bach shares the journey, offering her counterpoint to some of Richard's more challenging beliefs. This is a journal of terror and triumph, of forgotten childhood and its keys to grown-up mysteries.

In the Americas, virulent religious and class divisions, prejudice and oppression were rife, providing the fertile soil in which slavery and race hatred were planted and took root.Jacob is an Anglo-Dutch trader and adventurer, with a small holding in the harsh north. Despite his distaste for dealing in ""flesh,"" he takes a small slave girl in part payment for a bad debt from a plantation owner in Catholic Maryland. This is Florens, ""with the hands of a slave and the feet of a Portuguese lady."" Florens looks for love, first from Lina, an older servant woman at her new master's house, but later from a handsome blacksmith, an African, never enslaved.There are other voices: Lina, whose tribe was decimated by smallpox; their mistress, Rebekka, herself a victim of religious intolerance back in England; Sorrow, a strange girl who's spent her early years at sea; and finally the devastating voice of Florens' mother. These are all men and women inventing themselves in the wilderness.A Mercy reveals what lies beneath the surface of slavery.

The soloist,"""I'll be thirty-six years old this spring, which is young for a retired concert soloist, but old for a virgin. I started out as a musical prodigy...."".

So begins the third paragraph of the opening chapter of this incandescent novel. As an adolescent, Renne Sundheimer had the musical world at his feet; hailed as potentially the greatest cellist who ever lived, he toured the world's concert halls, basking in the adoration of his fans and the admiration of the critics.

Then suddenly, at the age of eighteen, his gift deserted him, and for the last fifteen years he has made his living as a cello teacher at a large university in Southern California, practicing five or six hours a day in the hope that his gift will return.

Suddenly Renne's life is altered radically by two disparate events: receiving a summons to jury duty, where he unwillingly becomes a juror in a murder trial for the brutal killing of a Buddhist monk; and becoming the teacher of another cello prodigy, an unprepossessing nine-year-old Korean boy whose brilliant talent, potential and musicianship remind Renne of his own past.

A Moveable Feast,"A Moveable Feast is a 1964 memoir belles-lettres by American author Ernest Hemingway about his years as a struggling expat journalist and writer in Paris during the 1920s. It was published posthumously.[1] The book details Hemingway's first marriage to Hadley Richardson and his associations with other cultural figures of the Lost Generation in Interwar France.

The memoir consists of various personal accounts by Hemingway and involves many notable figures of the time, such as Sylvia Beach, Hilaire Belloc, Bror von Blixen-Finecke, Aleister Crowley, John Dos Passos, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, Wyndham Lewis, Pascin, Ezra Pound, Evan Shipman, Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, and Hermann von Wedderkop. The work also references the addresses of specific locations such as bars, cafes, and hotels, many of which can still be found in Paris today.

Ernest Hemingway's suicide in July 1961 delayed the publication of the book due to copyright issues and several edits which were made to the final draft.

Magic Street,"Orson Scott Card has the distinction of having swept both the Hugo and Nebula awards in two consecutive years with his amazing novels Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. For a body of work that ranges from science fiction to nonfiction to plays, Card has been recognized as an author who provides vivid, colorful glimpses between the world we know and worlds we can only imagine.In a peaceful, prosperous African American neighborhood in Los Angeles, Mack Street is a mystery child who has somehow found a home. Discovered abandoned in an overgrown park, raised by a blunt-speaking single woman, Mack comes and goes from family to family--a boy who is at once surrounded by boisterous characters and deeply alone. But while Mack senses that he is different from most, and knows that he has strange powers, he cannot possibly understand how unusual he is until the day he sees, in a thin slice of space, a narrow house. Beyond it is a backyard--and an entryway into an extraordinary world stretching off into an exotic distance of geography, history, and magic.Passing through the skinny house that no one else can see, Mack is plunged into a realm where time and reality are skewed, a place where what Mack does and sees seem to have strange affects in the ""real world"" of concrete, cars, commerce, and conflict. Growing into a tall, powerful young man, pursuing a forbidden relationship, and using Shakespeare's Midsummer's Night Dream as a guide into the vast, timeless fantasy world, Mack becomes a player in an epic drama. Understanding this drama is Mack's challenge. His reward, if he can survive the trip, is discovering not only who he really is . . . but why he exists.Both a novel of constantly surprising entertainment and a tale of breathtaking literary power, Magic Street is a masterwork from a supremely gifted, utterly original American writer--a novel that uses realism and fantasy to delight, challenge, and satisfy on the most profound levels.From the Hardcover edition.","['Fantasy', 'Fiction', 'Fiction, fantasy, general']",,,,,['OL25161A'],12,orson scott card has the distinction of having swept both the hugo and nebula awards in two consecutive years with his amazing novels enders game and speaker for the dead for a body of work that ranges from science fiction to nonfiction to plays card has been recognized as an author who provides vivid colorful glimpses between the world we know and worlds we can only imaginein a peaceful prosperous african american neighborhood in los angeles mack street is a mystery child who has somehow found a home discovered abandoned in an overgrown park raised by a bluntspeaking single woman mack comes and goes from family to familya boy who is at once surrounded by boisterous characters and deeply alone but while mack senses that he is different from most and knows that he has strange powers he cannot possibly understand how unusual he is until the day he sees in a thin slice of space a narrow house beyond it is a backyardand an entryway into an extraordinary world stretching off into an exotic distance of geography history and magicpassing through the skinny house that no one else can see mack is plunged into a realm where time and reality are skewed a place where what mack does and sees seem to have strange affects in the real world of concrete cars commerce and conflict growing into a tall powerful young man pursuing a forbidden relationship and using shakespeares midsummers night dream as a guide into the vast timeless fantasy world mack becomes a player in an epic drama understanding this drama is macks challenge his reward if he can survive the trip is discovering not only who he really is but why he existsboth a novel of constantly surprising entertainment and a tale of breathtaking literary power magic street is a masterwork from a supremely gifted utterly original american writera novel that uses realism and fantasy to delight challenge and satisfy on the most profound levelsfrom the hardcover edition,3

The Envy of Angels,"In The Envy of Angels, C. Stephen Jaeger studies the German and French cathedral schools, the major centers of secular learning in Europe until the rise of the universities in the twelfth century. Jaeger argues that cathedral schools revived the learning of classical antiquity, shaped the codes of civility and courtesy, and ultimately transformed the social and intellectual life of Europe.

He further proposes that the schools were closely associated with medieval humanism and the Renaissance of the twelfth century, with the rise of Gothic style in architecture and sculpture, and with the formation of a courtly society, courtly literature, and courtly love.

The story of the rise and fall of the cathedral schools from 950 to 1200 is also the story of the transition in Europe from a charismatic world based on orality, memory, and personal authority to an intellectual culture based on literacy, texts, and written records.

Jaeger is particularly concerned with this notion of charismatic culture; he argues that the aim of charismatic teaching was to shape the student's character through the mystical force of the master's personality. The curriculum was not primarily defined by the set texts of study; the teacher himself was the curriculum, his presence radiating a transforming force to his students.

The essential feature of charismatic culture is that it makes the body and the physical presence into the medium which transmits cultural values. The controlled body with all its attributes - grace, posture, charm, sensuality, beauty - is the work of art of the eleventh century. If this ideal did not register in sculpture, art, or fiction, it is because the eleventh century had or sought the thing itself.

The human presence was the raw material ready to be shaped and formed like the clay on the potter's wheel or the sculptor's marble block, and the end product was a disciplined human being. The Envy of Angels will be of interest to students and scholars of medieval history, religion, literature, and art.","['Church schools', 'History', 'Medieval Education', 'Philosophy', 'Social aspects of Medieval education', 'Middle ages, history', 'Education, medieval', 'Europe, history, 476-1492', 'Europe, social conditions', 'Religious education, history', 'Education, philosophy', 'Education, social aspects', 'Social aspects']",['Europe'],,,,['OL23959A'],8,in the envy of angels c stephen jaeger studies the german and french cathedral schools the major centers of secular learning in europe until the rise of the universities in the twelfth century jaeger argues that cathedral schools revived the learning of classical antiquity shaped the codes of civility and courtesy and ultimately transformed the social and intellectual life of europe he further proposes that the schools were closely associated with medieval humanism and the renaissance of the twelfth century with the rise of gothic style in architecture and sculpture and with the formation of a courtly society courtly literature and courtly love the story of the rise and fall of the cathedral schools from 950 to 1200 is also the story of the transition in europe from a charismatic world based on orality memory and personal authority to an intellectual culture based on literacy texts and written records jaeger is particularly concerned with this notion of charismatic culture he argues that the aim of charismatic teaching was to shape the students character through the mystical force of the masters personality the curriculum was not primarily defined by the set texts of study the teacher himself was the curriculum his presence radiating a transforming force to his students the essential feature of charismatic culture is that it makes the body and the physical presence into the medium which transmits cultural values the controlled body with all its attributes grace posture charm sensuality beauty is the work of art of the eleventh century if this ideal did not register in sculpture art or fiction it is because the eleventh century had or sought the thing itself the human presence was the raw material ready to be shaped and formed like the clay on the potters wheel or the sculptors marble block and the end product was a disciplined human being the envy of angels will be of interest to students and scholars of medieval history religion literature and art,4
The Second Generation,"The children of heroes.
A fabulous quest to retrieve the Graystone Gem.
The legend of Raistlin’s daughter.

Many years ago, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman told the story of how the Companions of the Lance fought to save the world from sliding into darkness, fought to restore the fragile balance of good and evil.

The war was won. Peace came to Krynn. The Companions of the Lance became heroes. The river of time flowed on.

The heroes dreamed of finding safe harbor on that swift-running river. But the balance of eternal power is ever shifting, ever changing. The Queen of Darkness was defeated, not destroyed. Her powers are strong; people are weak. They forget the lessons of the past or close their eyes to them. The river’s waters grow more turbulent, dangerous.

It its not, however, the Heroes of the Lance who will be forced to plunge into the raging river of coming war. Their time is past. Their stories are told. It is for them now to hand the future to those younger, stronger.

The Celestine Prophecy - An Adventure,"Are three decades of interest in modern physics, ecology, mystical religion and interpersonal psychology finally synthesizing into a new spiritual ""common sense""? Are we now beginning to live this new common sense? Can it become the dominant paradigm of the next century?

When James Redfield first published this extraordinary book -- an adventure in pursuit of a spiritual mystery -- people picked it up, read it, and were stunned by its contents. They told their friends about it, and friends in turn told their friends. By word of mouth alone, news of this magical, moving work spread throughout the country, until -- within months of its first printing -- over hundred thousand readers had become excited by its predictions and touched by the way it made sense of what was happening in their lives.

Now you can discover for yourself the insights, the vision, and the uncanny accuracy of ""The Celestine Prophecy"". A parable filled with vital truth that reads like a gripping adventure-tale, it begins with the disappearance of an ancient Peruvian manuscript. Although few Westerners know of its existence and a government wants to suppress it, this precious document contains an important secret: the 9 insights the human race is predicted to grasp as we enter an era of true spiritual awareness.

To find the manuscript -- and its hidden treasures -- you will join one person's search. It is a quest that will carry you high into the Andes mountains, to ancient ruins deep in old-growth forest, and to a startling discovery. You will quickly recognize the truth of the First Insight: in each of our lives occur mysterious coincidences -- sudden, synchronistic events that, once interpreted, lead us into our true destiny.

When you find and understand all 9 of the insights, you will have an exciting new image of human life, and a positive vision of how we will save this planet, its creatures, and its beauty. ""The Celestine Prophecy"" will give you hope…and chills…as you begin to perceive its predictions unfolding all around you in intimate relationships and international affairs. And you will suddenly recognize the quantum leap forward humankind is preparing to make as we approach the new millennium. Important works such as Carlos Castaneda's ""The Teachings of Don Juan"" and the prophecies of Nostradamus have helped prepare the way for the revelations you will find in James Redfield's life-changing words. The time is right to hear them, and to discover the personal journey that is opening in your life.

"Forever and Ever, Amen","A funny, poignant account of a young woman's experiences becoming a Catholic nun during the tumultuous 1960s.  In 1964, Karol Jackowski was an eighteen-year-old girl just out of high school. But while her friends were heading off to college or finding their first jobs, Karol was following a different path. To the surprise of her family and friends, she decided to enter the convent of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in South Bend, Indiana, and spend the next eight years studying to become a Catholic nun.  Those years were a time of enormous change in the country and in the Church. They were times of joy, dedication, and a great deal of fun, set against the Second Vatican Council and the reforms it fostered, many of which remain controversial today. In this playful and candid memoir, Jackowski pulls back the curtain on the mysteries of convent life, as she recounts her rocky transition from worldly teenager to cloistered postulant; the trials she faced in coping with the restrictions of convent life (""nun of this and nun of that""); and the lessons she learned from the elderly nuns she was assigned to, who weren't nearly as pious as people thought. In prose that's as lively, insightful, and wise as she is, the author of Ten Fun Things to do Before You Die brings us a touching and heartfelt memoir of a woman following her true calling.","['Nuns', 'Nonfiction', 'Sisters of the Holy Cross', 'Biography & Autobiography', 'Religion & Spirituality', 'Biography', 'Nuns, biography']",['United States'],['Karol Jackowski'],,,['OL31053A'],7,a funny poignant account of a young womans experiences becoming a catholic nun during the tumultuous 1960s in 1964 karol jackowski was an eighteenyearold girl just out of high school but while her friends were heading off to college or finding their first jobs karol was following a different path to the surprise of her family and friends she decided to enter the convent of the sisters of the holy cross in south bend indiana and spend the next eight years studying to become a catholic nun those years were a time of enormous change in the country and in the church they were times of joy dedication and a great deal of fun set against the second vatican council and the reforms it fostered many of which remain controversial today in this playful and candid memoir jackowski pulls back the curtain on the mysteries of convent life as she recounts her rocky transition from worldly teenager to cloistered postulant the trials she faced in coping with the restrictions of convent life nun of this and nun of that and the lessons she learned from the elderly nuns she was assigned to who werent nearly as pious as people thought in prose thats as lively insightful and wise as she is the author of ten fun things to do before you die brings us a touching and heartfelt memoir of a woman following her true calling,7

Yet even as Beatrice's scheming seems about to yield her dream, she is haunted by the one living person who knows the extent of her plans...and her capacity for evil.

Sumptuously set in Georgian England, Wideacre is intensely gripping, rich in texture, and full of color and authenticity. It is a saga as irresistible in its singular magic as its heroine.

Editorial Reviews
Publishers Weekly - Publisher's Weekly
Gregory's full-blown first novel is a marvelously assured period piece, an English gothic with narrative verve. Beatrice Lacey loves nothing more than the family estate, Wideacrenot her bluff, hearty father, her weak brother, Harry, or her mother, who can't quite believe mounting evidence that damns her passionate daughter. Foiled in her hunger to own the estate by the 18th century laws of entail, Beatrice plots her father's death, knowing she can twist Harry in any direction she chooses, for her brother harbors a dark, perverted secret. Their incestuous tangle is not broken even by Harry's marriage. And while a bounteous harvest multiplies, no one gainsays the young squire and his sister, the true master of Wideacre. Beatrice marries also, managing to hide the paternity of two children sired by Harry until her increasing greed squeezes the land and its people dry, and the seeds of destruction she has sown come to their awful fruition. Gregory effortlessly breathes color and life into a tale of obsession built around a ruthless, fascinating woman.

Christianity and the Social Crisis in the 21st Century,"In the wake of the success of God's Politics, comes an anniversary edition of Walter Rauschenbusch's Christianity and the Social Crisis, a book which outsold every other religious volume for three years and which has become a classic and mainstay for any Christian seriously interested in social justice.PBS has named Rauschenbusch one of the most influential American religious leaders in the last 100 years, and Christianity Today named this book one of the top books of the century that have shaped contemporary religious thought. So it seems fitting on the 100th anniversary of the publication of Christianity and the Social Crisis that Rauschenbush's great–grandson should bring this classic back into print, adding a response to each chapter by a well–known contemporary author such as Jim Wallis, Tony Camplo, Cornel West, Richard Rorty, Stanley Hauerwas, and others.Between 1886 and 1897, he was pastor of the Second German Baptist Church in the ""Hell's Kitchen"" area of New York City, an area of extreme poverty. As he witnessed massive economic insecurity, he began to believe that Christianity must address the physical as well as the spiritual needs of humankind. Rauschenbusch saw it as his duty as a minister and student of Christ to act with love by trying to improve social conditions.This, in fact, inspired leaders such as Reinhold and Richard Niebuhr, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mahatma Ghandi and Bishop Desmond Tutu. ""Christianity is in its nature revolutionary"" Rauschenbusch wrote, and the significance of his work is that it spoke of society's responsibility to the poor and downtrodden.In the present atmosphere of heightened debate and even antagonism between political and religious viewpoints Christianity and the Social Crisis will again be a book that will provoke intense responses by people on every side. As the disparity between the rich and the poor in America continues to widen in the 21st century, the book's explication of the radical social message of Jesus is as applicable today as it was 100 years ago.","['Ethics', 'Nonfiction', 'Politics', 'Christian sociology', 'Social ethics', 'Church and social problems', 'Church and social problems, united states']",,,,,['OL21395A'],7,in the wake of the success of gods politics comes an anniversary edition of walter rauschenbuschs christianity and the social crisis a book which outsold every other religious volume for three years and which has become a classic and mainstay for any christian seriously interested in social justicepbs has named rauschenbusch one of the most influential american religious leaders in the last 100 years and christianity today named this book one of the top books of the century that have shaped contemporary religious thought so it seems fitting on the 100th anniversary of the publication of christianity and the social crisis that rauschenbushs greatgrandson should bring this classic back into print adding a response to each chapter by a wellknown contemporary author such as jim wallis tony camplo cornel west richard rorty stanley hauerwas and othersbetween 1886 and 1897 he was pastor of the second german baptist church in the hells kitchen area of new york city an area of extreme poverty as he witnessed massive economic insecurity he began to believe that christianity must address the physical as well as the spiritual needs of humankind rauschenbusch saw it as his duty as a minister and student of christ to act with love by trying to improve social conditionsthis in fact inspired leaders such as reinhold and richard niebuhr rev martin luther king jr mahatma ghandi and bishop desmond tutu christianity is in its nature revolutionary rauschenbusch wrote and the significance of his work is that it spoke of societys responsibility to the poor and downtroddenin the present atmosphere of heightened debate and even antagonism between political and religious viewpoints christianity and the social crisis will again be a book that will provoke intense responses by people on every side as the disparity between the rich and the poor in america continues to widen in the 21st century the books explication of the radical social message of jesus is as applicable today as it was 100 years ago,4

The Storrington papers,"For Sarah Goodwill, still reeling in the aftershock of a disastrous marriage, the position of secretary-ghostwriter to Major Charles Storrington seems the ideal opportunity to exorcise a few demons of her own. Sarah will help Major Storrington, confined to a wheelchair by the tank accident that finished a promising military career, to research and write the family history of the Storringtons, an armaments dynasty. She will also serve as governess to his small son.

To her dismay, Sarah finds the ménage at Maidenshall, the great Victorian mansion built on the site of a nunnery, a decidedly uneasy one:

* Bored, diversion-starved Cressida increasingly seeks escape in her London fashion career and, perhaps, in the arms of other men;

* Adolphus Storrington is a lonely, distracted child who spends most of his waking hours in the company of a fantasy playmate;

Living the Bill of Rights,"Nat Hentoff is one of America's foremost and most passionate writers about civil liberties and civil rights. In Living the Bill of Rights, he has taken what is too often thought of as an abstract issue and enlivened it by focusing on representative individuals for whom the Constitution is a vital part of life.

Hentoff covers the full range of American life in these inspiring and moving profiles and stories and portrays such fighters for the Bill of Rights as a high school senior in Tennessee who is a born-again Christian; a black Texas lawyer fired by the local NAACP for representing a Klan wizard on constitutional grounds; Justice William Brennan himself; another Supreme Court justice, William O.

Douglas, the preeminent supporter of the individual against the government; and a professional basketball star who, for religious reasons, would not participate in a display of mass loyalty to the American flag.

Soldiers' pay,"<p><i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> is <a href=""https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/william-faulkner"">William Faulkner’s</a> first published novel. It begins with a train journey on which two American soldiers, Joe Gilligan and Julian Lowe, are returning from the First World War. They meet a scarred, lethargic, and withdrawn fighter pilot, Donald Mahon, who was presumed dead by his family. The novel continues to focus on Mahon and his slow deterioration, and the various romantic complications that arise upon his return home.</p>
			<p>Faulkner drew inspiration for this novel from his own experience of the First World War. In the spring of 1918, he moved from his hometown, Oxford, Mississippi, to Yale and worked as an accountant until meeting a Canadian Royal Air Force pilot who encouraged him to join the R.A.F. He then traveled to Toronto, pretended to be British (he affected a British accent and forged letters from British officers and a made-up Reverend), and joined the R.A.F. in the hopes of becoming a hero. But the war ended before he was able to complete his flight training, and, like Julian Lowe, he never witnessed actual combat. Upon returning to Mississippi, he began fabricating various heroic stories about his time in the air force (like narrowly surviving a plane crash with broken legs and metal plates under the skin), and proudly strode around Oxford in his uniform.</p>
			<p>Faulkner was encouraged to write <i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> by his close friend and fellow writer <a>Sherwood Anderson</a>, whom Faulkner met in New Orleans. Anderson wrote in his <i>Memoirs</i> that he went “personally to Horace Liveright”—<i>Soldiers’ Pay</i> was originally published by Boni &amp; Liveright—“to plead for the book.”</p>
			<p>Though the novel was a commercial failure at the time of its publication, Faulkner’s subsequent fame has ensured its long-term success.</p>","['American Manuscripts', 'World War, 1914-1918', 'Veterans', 'Facsimiles', 'Fiction', 'Manuscripts', 'American fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'Fiction, historical, general', 'World war, 1914-1918, fiction', 'Officers', 'War wounds', 'Armed Forces', 'United States.

The Prairie,"Deep in the heart of the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase, five hundred miles beyond the Mississippi River, a group of travelers in the year 1805 pushes yet farther westward over the prairie. Called ""squatters"" and equipped with covered wagons, livestock, farming implements, and household furnishings, they give every appearance of being ordinary settlers except for the fact they have bypassed the fertile river bottoms for the less productive Great Plains. This group is comprised of the rough, semiliterate Ishmael and Esther Bush, now in their fifties; their numerous children, including seven grown sons; Esther's brother, Abiram White; Ellen Wade, a niece, whose bearing bespeaks a more refined background; and Dr. Obed Bat, an eccentric naturalist. In search of a camping place for the night, they are suddenly confronted by a colossal figure who momentarily fills them with superstitious awe. It is Natty Bumppo, whose form, greatly magnified by an optical illusion, is outlined against the setting sun on the horizon. Once a hunter and scout but now reduced in his old age to trapping, Natty is almost as startled as the newcomers by the encounter. It has been months since the octogenarIan has seen white people so far beyond the settlements.

Ragtime,"Published in 1975, Ragtime changed our very concept of what a novel could be. An extraordinary tapestry, Ragtime captures the spirit of America in the era between the turn of the century & the First World War. The story opens in 1906 in New Rochelle, NY, at the home of an affluent American family. One lazy Sunday afternoon, the famous escape artist Harry Houdini swerves his car into a telephone pole outside their house. Almost magically, the line between fantasy & historical fact, between real & imaginary characters, disappears. Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, J.P. Morgan, Evelyn Nesbit, Sigmund Freud & Emiliano Zapata slip in & out of the tale, crossing paths with Doctorow's imagined family & other fictional characters, including an immigrant peddler & a ragtime musician from Harlem whose insistence on a point of justice drives him to revolutionary violence.","['Fiction', 'History', 'Race relations', 'African American families', 'Fiction in English', 'Jewish families', 'National Book Critics Circle Award Winner', 'Einwanderer', 'Ragtime', 'English fiction', 'United States -- History -- 1901-1909 -- Fiction', 'New York (State) -- History -- 1865-  -- Fiction', 'Metropolitan Museum of Art', 'Large type books', 'American fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'New york (state), fiction', 'Fiction, historical, general']","['United States', 'New York (State)', 'New York', 'New York (N.Y.)', 'Harlem']","['Henry Ford', 'Emma Goldman (1869-1940)', 'J.P.

Violin,"Violin, released October 15, 1997, is Anne Rice's richly alluring new ghost novel that moves across the centuries to tell the story of three charismatic figures wrapped in music. A return to the romanticism of her first books, wild, passionate, tormented, operatic, Violin moves from nineteenth-century Vienna to modern New Orleans to Rio de Janiero telling the story of three unforgettable people. The first is an exquisite and vulnerable young woman who dreams of becoming a great musician. The second is a brilliantly talented and dangerously seductive violinist--a ghost--who uses his gifts, and his magic violin, to engage and dominate the emotions of his prey. The third who, in essence, is always present, is the spectre of Beethoven. The dramatic interplay of their ambitions, dreams, and desires are the stuff of an operatic tale full of passion and music. Fortissimo in feeling--a novel in the unique Anne Rice grand manner. Anne is flattered by the above, obviously she did not write this.

Reading Dante's stars,"""This book makes a sustained analysis of Dante's use of astronomy, not only in terms of the precepts of medieval science but also in relation to specific moral, philosophical, and poetic problems laid out in each chapter."".

""For Dante, Alison Cornish says, the stars offer optical representations of invisible realities, from divine providence to the workings of the human soul. Dante's often puzzling celestial figures call attention to the physical world as a scene of reading in which visible phenomena are subject to more than one explanation, Cornish contends. The poetry of Dante's astronomy, as well as its difficulty, rests on this imperative of interpretation.

English music,"From the prize-winning author of First Light, Chatterton, and Hawksmoor - a dazzlingly inventive and powerfully moving novel about the intricate ties between fathers and sons, between inheritance and culture, and between our understanding of the past and our grasp of the present. In post-World War I London, on the stage of the out-of-the-way Chemical Theatre, Clement Harcombe and his young, motherless son, Timothy, perform acts of spiritual healing, their visionary skills lifting the weight of despair and failure from the shoulders of their small band of followers. For Timothy, a boy with remarkable psychic gifts, it is a thrilling apprenticeship, a wonderful life with an adored father. But in the eyes of the larger world, it is a wayward existence with a suspect parent. And when Timothy is abruptly removed from his father's side, from the familiar twilit world of phantoms and ghosts, and thrust into the simple world of his grandparents' home in the country, he is not too young to feel 'bereft of his past'. Yet nothing can remove him from the realm of his visions. And as he passes from a difficult childhood into a troubled adulthood - his father slipping in and out of his life - it is this other, private world that provides him with his only certainty. In his visions - unanticipated and wholly enveloping - Timothy is drawn into the creations of Charles Dickens and William Blake, Thomas Malory and Daniel Defoe, John Bunyan, Arthur Conan Doyle, Thomas Gainsborough and J.M.W. Turner. Accompanied by Merlin or Miss Havisham, William Byrd or William Hogarth, Crusoe's Friday or Wonderland's Alice, Timothy is swept across time and history. And as his mysterious journeys begin to illuminate the ideas that have shaped them, Timothy comes to discern the power of the writer over his characters, the composer over what is heard, the painter over what is perceived - learns, finally, to hear the 'English music' his father described to him as a child. It is the workings of the English imagination through the centuries, Timothy's cultural heritage, inside which lies the key to his understanding, and his acceptance, of the often perplexing ideas and emotions that are his singular inheritance from his father. English Music is a tour de force of imagination and evocation - a startling, masterful novel from one of the most exciting writers at work today.","['Fiction', 'Fathers and sons', 'Psychic ability', 'Young men', 'Children', 'History', 'Music, english', 'English fiction']",['London (England)'],,,,['OL21220A'],7,from the prizewinning author of first light chatterton and hawksmoor a dazzlingly inventive and powerfully moving novel about the intricate ties between fathers and sons between inheritance and culture and between our understanding of the past and our grasp of the present in postworld war i london on the stage of the outoftheway chemical theatre clement harcombe and his young motherless son timothy perform acts of spiritual healing their visionary skills lifting the weight of despair and failure from the shoulders of their small band of followers for timothy a boy with remarkable psychic gifts it is a thrilling apprenticeship a wonderful life with an adored father but in the eyes of the larger world it is a wayward existence with a suspect parent and when timothy is abruptly removed from his fathers side from the familiar twilit world of phantoms and ghosts and thrust into the simple world of his grandparents home in the country he is not too young to feel bereft of his past yet nothing can remove him from the realm of his visions and as he passes from a difficult childhood into a troubled adulthood his father slipping in and out of his life it is this other private world that provides him with his only certainty in his visions unanticipated and wholly enveloping timothy is drawn into the creations of charles dickens and william blake thomas malory and daniel defoe john bunyan arthur conan doyle thomas gainsborough and jmw turner accompanied by merlin or miss havisham william byrd or william hogarth crusoes friday or wonderlands alice timothy is swept across time and history and as his mysterious journeys begin to illuminate the ideas that have shaped them timothy comes to discern the power of the writer over his characters the composer over what is heard the painter over what is perceived learns finally to hear the english music his father described to him as a child it is the workings of the english imagination through the centuries timothys cultural heritage inside which lies the key to his understanding and his acceptance of the often perplexing ideas and emotions that are his singular inheritance from his father english music is a tour de force of imagination and evocation a startling masterful novel from one of the most exciting writers at work today,3
Looking around,"From the opening sentences of his first book on architecture. Home, Witold Rybczynski seduced readers into a new appreciation of the spaces they live in. He also introduced us to ""an unerringly lucid writer who knows how to translate architectural ideas into layman's terms"" (The Dallas Morning News). Rybczynski's vast knowledge, his sense of wonder, and his elegantly uncluttered prose shine on every page of his latest meditation on the art of building.

Looking Around is about architecture as an art of compromise - between beauty and function, aspiration and engineering, builders and clients. It is the story of the Seagram Building in New York and the Wexner Center for the Visual Arts in Columbus, Ohio - a museum that opened without a single painting on view, so that critics could better appreciate its design. But what of the visitors who want a building that displays art well? What of those who work in the building?

Looking Around explores the notion of the architect as superstar and assesses giants from Palladio to Michael Graves, styles from classicism to high tech. It demonstrates how architecture actually works - or doesn't - in corporate headquarters, airports, private homes, and the special buildings designed to represent our civilization. For all its erudition, Looking Around is also bracingly straightforward.

Rybczynski looks closely and critically at structures that may once have dazzled us with their ostentation and expense, and sees them as triumphs or failures - of aesthetic ideals and of lasting function. This is a fascinating and illuminating book about an art form integral to our lives.","['Themes, motives', 'Architecture', 'Dwellings', 'Thèmes, motifs', 'New York Times reviewed']",,,,,['OL21731A'],8,from the opening sentences of his first book on architecture home witold rybczynski seduced readers into a new appreciation of the spaces they live in he also introduced us to an unerringly lucid writer who knows how to translate architectural ideas into laymans terms the dallas morning news rybczynskis vast knowledge his sense of wonder and his elegantly uncluttered prose shine on every page of his latest meditation on the art of building looking around is about architecture as an art of compromise between beauty and function aspiration and engineering builders and clients it is the story of the seagram building in new york and the wexner center for the visual arts in columbus ohio a museum that opened without a single painting on view so that critics could better appreciate its design but what of the visitors who want a building that displays art well what of those who work in the building looking around explores the notion of the architect as superstar and assesses giants from palladio to michael graves styles from classicism to high tech it demonstrates how architecture actually works or doesnt in corporate headquarters airports private homes and the special buildings designed to represent our civilization for all its erudition looking around is also bracingly straightforward rybczynski looks closely and critically at structures that may once have dazzled us with their ostentation and expense and sees them as triumphs or failures of aesthetic ideals and of lasting function this is a fascinating and illuminating book about an art form integral to our lives,4
